Slightly too long in the leg for 5.1" lady

very good value for money. fitted like a glove

First walk of about 10 miles across mixed terrain of tarmac through rock scree - no blisters, very comfortable.  Sole shank is firm without being too stiff.  Toes feel well protected by reinforced front.  Vibram sole grips well,  but still allows you to feel the texture under your feet.  Cannot comment on water resistance as it was a nice sunny day.... Shoe also accepted a set of stiff orthotic inserts with no discomfort.

Women's Elevation Pants

Stitching rough on one side

A little heavier than the newer style but more comfy.

Easy to wear due to zips and press buttons on side of pants

Would rather have belt loops and not the internal belt which is quite narrow.

Had to exchange an 8 for a 10 - quite small sizing.

Noisy when you move around on it!

Would have liked a drink holder on the arm

Bought for my wife who found them extremely comfy straight from the box

Good quality. Work well.

Helium 3.8 Warm Zone Sleeping Mat

Warm and comfortable

A BIT PRICEY

Unfortunately they do wear out but it takes time to do so!

Reliable cooking

Footwear Repel

Although the weight is fine it's quite long when packed. Pegs not brilliant.

Good for driving, good for running.  Dark, but not too dark

Pockets could be bigger.

Some initial soreness. I put on a plaster and it was fine after that. Either my foot or the sandal adjusted!

Easy to use.  Fast drying.  Immediate effect of waterproofing.

Improves water repellency to a degree. Don’t expect night and day difference though. Certainly better than not treating your clothing at all!

Warm yet good movement!

The zip for the inner is just a single. A double zip would probably be better.

will wear out quite quickly which makes it on the pricey side

A classic. Remarkably light to wear, but tough and windproof. Tried out on Tryfan and Skye - they just work.

Womens Tokee Fleece Jacket

A bit pricy up front but I bought in the sale so I got a good deal

Great fit

It would be helpful if there was an extra zipped compartment on the outside for socks

Velcro fasten for easy on and off, good comfortable fitting shoe.

Wore out quicker than anticipated in view of the price.

No its really good

Mens Bhutan MFS Boot

They weren't fit for purpose - they weren't waterproof

They are fairly expensive (worth it), but it also takes some time to get used to them.

very comfortable and very light

Nearly seamless and superb leather with rubber bumper all around

Very lightweight. Good secure fit, no chance of coming off accidentally.  ||| Great protection from bright and harsh light...particularly useful with this winter sun! ||| Gradient lenses are useful without being too obvious. ||| Great colour too.

warm in winter and cool in summer

Laces seem a little short - I prefer to 'double bow' mine on boots.

The fact that it isn't available in more colours. Only 3 colours available aqua, blue and black but don't don't do black. Defiantly need it in more colours please ?.

Scafell 300+ Tent

Not keen on colour

It works

Mens Momentum Climbing Shoe

This hat is spf factor 50. ||| Great colour & comes in a good range of sizes. ||| Washable.

Decided not to take them on long walk in Alps as not substantial enough in harsh terrain

Very good climbing shoe overall.

Good size fingers

XL-Bowl

Glacier 5.0 Sleeping Mat

Pasta Cheese with Mushroom

So comfy. ||| Much better than your average trainer.

Not long lasting but pleasant to use

Zips for zip-off legs are a bit small & fiddly: more difficult to do up than older versions of same style.

Good quality trousers, with a belt. Very warm and comfortable.

Mens Pulse Long Sleeve Zip Tee

It is higher than most seats and comfortable for a folding chair.

Very good in the cold weather of the past few days and flexible with the fleece lining being removable. ||| Hard wearing (I had one before) but it had become a bit too tight fitting of late! ||| Good value with the National Trust discount too.

Not able to wash the glove. As I often use this in muddy outdoor areas this is a problem

Great fit, extremely warm, and just what I wanted

Piezo Ignitor

Comfortable to wear, easy wash and dry ready for the next day

Very effective treatment

Small pockets.Zip already broken.

It's just the right size for either putting in your pack or taking on the river when Kayaking or Open Canoeing

might be too hot in summer but don't know yet.

They kept my hands warm all day while walking around Durham.

It had a good sale discount off the original price and lowest price compared to the other brands and types

Keeps drinks warm for a long time

Small

Soft to wear

TX Direct Spray On 300ml

The bargain price and it is pretty

N/a

Compact and easy to use.

Very light, very easy to set up and the most comfortable camping chair I've ever had.

Would like it to include a couple of Karabiners for racking nuts.

Item bought for reserve stock not yet used in anger.I act as "Q" for a Cadet unit but have bought and used similar equipment before.

Men's Vapour-rise Alpine Jacket

the type of gas used.

Chocolate Pudding

Price-quality ratio. ||| Colour. ||| Feet and firm/sold base.

Third pair of these. Excellent shoes.

I found that I got a type of heat rash on my ankles around the cuff - I noticed someone else also had this with merino socks.  I get it around the neck of my icebreaker merino t- short too so am thinking it is a reaction to the wool or elastic.

Men's Paradiso Jacket

Fits all and good value

Very easy to use, also use it on garments that aren't really meant to be waterproof to great effect.

Good quality, does the job effectively.

T5MO Organic Cotton Airflo Hat

The clip at the front onto the boot lace is almost impossible to get on plus it is in unside down format

Stays cool enough to hold

Very comfortable even on first use

For the price they could have oiled or Nik waxed them ! ||| Also would have liked the rubber taper to continue over the toe for added protection ,I can see the toe edge wearing over time,but this is not a huge issue and shouldn't put a serious hiker off.

Girls Neckwarmer Buff

After first wear and wash, the fabric has started to pill which is probably a consequence of the breathability and flexibility of the fabric which is a good trade off. overall. The capris would also benefit from UV protection but loose enough fit for protection underneath.

Needs clean often  ||| If not cleaned and left to dry will clog up really fast and nearly impossible to clean

Brilliant

Just the job, tough and very lightweight

Rather expensive .

Comfortable well fitting and warm ideal for the winter months ahead

Stay up well. Look smart. Fit shape of leg and walking boot well. Offer good protection against water and mud when walking. Warm too. Easy to clean

Little cartridges are disproportionately expensive compared to big

Comfortable, did a great job of keeping me warm.

Very comfortable and warm on cold days and fairly quick drying

Hood fit is quite large even when using the adjuster

Taste / texture is bit off. However it is edible.

Dew can leak through if you touch the outer layer. Just something to be careful of.

Small porch means rain gets into the tent.

Price seems a lot compared with other brands.

They haven't lasted long - only lasted a few trips.

Well made

After just 2 weeks of daily use and being topped up with air, the bed is beginning to lose its shape and bulge at the sides

fit

goo intermediate boot thats quite comfy

Comfortable for everyday wear.

Lovely snug fit with elasticated sides and protective cap on the toes which is great for walking on uneven ground. Plenty of air spaces to let the feet breath.

Boys Moab FST Mid Waterproof Boot

Mater dries extremely quickly - perfect for mixed weather and the vents give excellent breathability when it gets warm! The strengthened knee sections are great for scrambling too!

Great. Simple and bright with optional easy to use dimming

Mens Altus Vest

Light and quite fast to pitch

A great piece of kit that fits perfectly in my old Trangia stove. Performs really well, heats up so much more quickly than the meths burner and is easily adjustable.

Heavier than I had hoped for

NAO+ 750L Headtorch

These plasters completely stopped the pain from a heal blister and enabled me to carry on walking. Underneath the plaster, which stayed on for several days, the skin healed.

Works well with the new pivot belay device.

Mens Stainton Half Zip Fleece

So comfortable that you forget you’re wearing shoes

I bought these for a folk festival which was very wet. I can put the trousers over my denims tucked into my wellies and walk around or sit down at outside tables in comfort and then open up the side zips to avoid overheating when in the concert venues. They are also easy to remove for when I want to dance. Brilliant

Tikkina 150L Headtorch

Prefer original style from few years ago.

Very comfortable, little boy loves wearing them

😀

Womens Hedgehog Fastpack GTX Shoe

supports my instep whilst walking ||| therefore adding comfort to the ||| boots

Wind and waterproof. Hood is easy to adjust and is the best fit I've ever had.  ||| Pit vents easy to open. ||| Love the colour!

Comfy, light and supportive.

Does what it says on the spray - great for waterproofing jackets, shoes, etc.  I love it for doing some of my lightweight cardigans/jackets in case I get caught in summer showers.  Works a treat

perfect, love the quality

The Mini Karabiners (Pack of 3) are small and light but strong which is what I was looking for. They are useful for work bags or daysacks.

Nice fit , high waisted very comfortable

Womens Deluge Overtrousers

i have a large head- it fits perfectly

Great top the wife loves it a really warm base or mid layer also looks great with a pair of jeans

This is my second pair of this model. The first pair I bought in 2007 so I can't really argue with their durability. The first pair were quite tight on my feet, which was fine - better than having blisters - but I couldn't wait to get them off after a long day's walking. With these I have gone up a size and wear thicker socks to compensate which has really improved comfort and so far I haven't suffered any blisters.

Take care how much water you add if you don't like soggy pasta. I put in enough to just cover the pasta and it worked perfectly for my taste.

FiT, style, durability... everything brilliant

Trek 3 Sleeping Mat Standard

Good value at reduced price

Streamlined design so no baggy flapping fabric.

I would have quite liked the jacket to be slightly longer to cover my hips well.

Strong material. Good fit. Nice short leg for size small leg. Pretty good in the rain - resistant.

Mens R-Evo GTX Boot

Good UV index good wide brim that's not to wide airy

A heavy boot but to be expected for one that is so robust.

Very cosy even in the wind

nice feel to these socks. very happy with, comfy and warm just what a sock should be

Easy to take on and off. Seem very strong but flexible. Not too heavy to carry. I've worn them twice in snow and ice and they work very well.

I love this coat!

My fault as I dud not realise they came up so large but I will try to exchange.

You require the wash to make the reproof ingredients effective

washes well ||| looks good

Light but warm

Works well

Excellent fit.

However, the design means its sometimes awkward with its hand-holes instead of arms, to use your hands. ||| The neck fastener somehow got ripped off early on.

Expensive for what they are. Cheaper options on the market at the same quality.

Love the design

BMC Terra Pants Limited Edition

Not the strongest for ankle support

Completely waterproof

Readily available at Cotswod

Fingers weren't warm enough when it was really cold, but I do tend to feel the cold a lot

Ticks all the boxes for the outdoors and looks good enough to wear in the high St.

Comfortable and easy to inflate - and just as important - deflate. ||| Small pack size. ||| Reasonably lightweight. ||| Better than the short version, which I find tends to rotate if I move.

Transpiration Footbed

No

- it's warm ||| - got a nice fitting

You may need to bleed it after re-filling ...not difficult , but not obvious !

It’s taking some thinking, that’s it not enough

This is the best flask I have bought. It kept our drinks hot for 5 hours.  The cap is easy to screw on and the whole flask feels good quality. ||| Would definitively recommend this product.

The price is a little steep and the material has started to bobble in areas.

No red night light useful in bunkbarns etc when not wanting to disturb others

Cosmos Sleeping Bag

Hard ridge at the top of the toecap inside. Rubs my big toe.

Pricey.

1 button, easy to use, 3 light strengths, well made, looks like it will last a long time, unlike some of the cheaper products I've seen.  This is a good product at the price.

The packaging is sufficiently tough for carrying on an expedition

The identical pair I had prior to this new pair were not 100% waterproof, which I found annoying for a boot in this price range. I have not exposed the new pair to wet conditions as yet so cannot comment on how waterproof they are.

Has not let me down

Mens Terra Fi 4 Sandal

The new pump sac isn't as handy as you can't put your sleeping system in as you can with the old one.

Very light weight which is great for long load carrying as well as the small space it takes up due to its packing size. ||| A great warm weather bag.

Nothing to date

Breathable tops with just enough padding underneath.

Great replacement for a previous (16 year old) Berghaus product. 3 in 1 will take my Polartec Fleece easily. Well thought out product, well made too.

Good fit , great value , not used yet in bad weather but as it's goretex that should be be no problem

Mens Grand Valley Softshell Jacket

Well worth the investment! Great female fit, stay in place and look good too!

Great quality ||| No bad points - some might say expensive, but you get what you pay for and this is worth every penny

Expedition Breakfast

Mens Renegade GTX Lo Shoe

Comfortable from the start and an excellent grip on rocky ground. Good ankle support without being too stiff.

Great looking top and feels great on. It’s a great  synthetic base layer for when your out but also looks fantastic with a pair of jeans

The fit

Style and colour

Trangia Gas Burner

Stayed inflated

not very warm

easy to put up, great size,very good in the wind

On my second top after the seams on the first started coming away after wearing 3 times ||| Hopefully this one will be fine

Titanium Plate

Best I’ve ever had - I need to look for shoe type now as an alternative for good weather walking.

Zipped pocket occasionally jams

It looks very good and does its job well

Hooks for clipping on the roof of the tent.  ||| Brightness can be adjusted.

Mens Glacier Delta 1/4 Zip Fleece

Liked the waterproof bag in the leg pocket.  ||| Light and extremely comfortable.

These coils do seem to repel mosquitos effectively and they smell kinda nice while doing so.

feet strapping makes shoe easier to put on.Can`t stand the sandals - closed at the top - where you have to pull the elastic to the required tightness.SO uncomfortable.  ||| Sufficient track on the shoes for hiking. ||| In fact, if you could produce the shoes with even more track, that would be great, as walking a lot means the track disappears too quickly.

I use it in the gym for weight lifting and it's great. Really helps my grip. Much easier to use than powdered chalk, less mess, less wastage and stays longer on my hands.

Didn't buy them sooner.

Very good fit especially around the ankles. Plenty of decent sized pockets.

Good fit and sizing well made

Comfortable throughout the whole day.

Substantial product

Great fit, very comfy, the Velcro strap is useful at the bottom of the pant if climbing or bouldering to keep trouser out of the way.  ||| The cooling sections are also a great idea and work a treat. Would defiantly buy these again.

Well made.

None I know of

Brenin ABS Harness

Only worn the jacket once at this stage, but it is a lovely light jacket which only requires a lightweight fleece for general hiking. Nice shell to wear anywhere really. I like this particular Berghaus jacket. I have many Berghaus jackets but it’s nice to have a lightweight one. Highly recommend the Deluge Pro.

Simple to pitch, good amount of room for a 1 man tent and great value for money

Although trousers stretch, obviously the lining doesn't ,but not a fault just a observation, just don't sit down and expect the lining to move with you. ||| But great warm trousers

Flexibility of leg length; slightly longer length shorts than older version of same style.

Zip pocket's could be less sharp, plastic maybe.

It works well, even n adverse conditions

Found the sizes too wide for my hands, and the thumbs are very long!

I would have liked a cargo pocket on each leg.

Silk Liner-Traveller

odd feather coming from stitch.however not a issue

I wish there was a waterproof internal pocket to stash a phone in.

Velcro quick and easy

Very comfortable  ||| Cool to wear (its not supposed to be warm)

Perhaps a bit too slim fitting - not much room  round the knees when you're sitting down.

Compact Kumfie Sit Mat

Maybe just a bit plain in design

TX Direct Wash In 300ml

Mens Oban Sky Jacket

Good length sleeves and body with piped edging.

Fabric is noisy, rustling and shushing as you walk.

Quite slim torso cut, also could usefully be 2" longer in the body

Waterproof, with good pockets.

quite heavy , its a car to transport and not a 3 mile walk to the beech

Good fit

Well made and does the job

Very comfortable & easy to use

Love this merino long sleeve top. Perfect for hiking, walking and other outdoor activities.  Merino is so comfortable and warm.

Very Waterproof, plenty of space for helmet and ample pocket room.

Tech Wash/TX Direct Pack

Possibly a choice of colours?

Packs down

Comfy and look good. Feel great on your feet when out walking.

Really compactable and toasty warm across two seasons. Baffles n hood work really well to keep heat in.

The price...expensive.  ||| Soles are very slippery on wet surfaces.

Mens Sirkos GTX Shoe

Everything about this jacket is good the price, the look, the feel, the design and performs well when its ment to

But pricey but I got a good Rspb volunteer discount. Might get hot feet but there is a non goretex version which would be worth a look if you don’t need waterproof shoe.

Not really keen on the colour, but that is all. I can certainly live with it and it wouldn't stop me from buying them in the future .

Warm and showerproof - were warm enough in the snow. More feminine than other similar trousers.

You have to take real care of them so they last. This is my third pair in 5 years. ||| My fault I didn't treat them with the products advised.

Wide Mouth Tritan Bottle 1 Ltr

Mens NosiLife Adventure Jacket II

Bought to replace another one my husband lost as its so good.  Keeps drinks hot and is easy to clean, all of us have one in our fanily.

Excellent quality; however a bit cumbersome.

Sturdy and well made.

They don't come in purple!

Waist a bit low down for me and they pull a bit over the knees. Wouldn't use them for scrambling.

Would be nice if had pockets

Bought it as a twin pack so offer was good.  Also easy to use and results afterwards were great.

A purposeful glove that is proving to be a useful purposeful purchase.

good fit not skimped on length

Bag is fine except for the below (pretty critical) point...

Very easy to use spray. Does what it says on the tin

Mens Downpour Plus Jacket

Only option was a zip on the left. I got very cold my first time sleeping in it but i was cold already, wearing less means you will be warmer i found with his bag.

Colour and price.

Laces are too long

Button feels a bit cheap.

Womens Northern Comfort Hybrid Jacket

A bit 'greasy'

Quite easy to apply

Fit well! ||| Good value for little money. ||| Great work trousers.

Stainless steel and because of the design it’s light weight too

Works ok for a shot time .

Easy to use and adjust. Comfortable fit with a good amount of padding.

Comfortable from the first walk and I think they look great. Having just done a 13 mile hilly walk I can say I walked the downhill bits with more confidence than usual due to the great soles.

Good wide mouth; seems robust

Good beginner climbing shoe, nice solid sole

Lightweight walk for miles no effort ||| east to maintain this is my second pair ||| the other pair are still in use no need for costly sole repairs they seem to last forever they are used four to five days a week on rough terrain ||| I have other boots but they need sole replacements too often or are very heavy to wear for a long period

The fit is not so good for someone who is little bit overweight, so an option with an extra inch or two  in the waist and one less inch in the arms would be a great improvement.

Lovely, soft and stretchy - soooo comfortable. Plenty of leg room without being baggy, so bending and stretching is effortless and fearless (whether climbing trees and boulders, or just looking after 24 active Beavers). ||| No nasty crotch seams in uncomfortable places for women. ||| Surprisingly flattering cut for someone with a big bum. Fabric thick enough to disguise lumps & bumps in skin/underwear. ||| Highish waist that tapers in to a woman's shape, so no unfortunate gaping and accidentally revealing underwear! ||| Well placed, large, secure pockets. ||| Good leg length. ||| Poppers on ankles handy for tucking trousers into wellies, also to prevent flapping trouser legs tripping you up or catching in your bike chain - and when they're not done up, the legs are the perfect width.

Laces are a bit thin I will upgrade them ASAP

The laces tend to feel a bit short.

Easy to put on and not too wide at the calf.

Mens Short Sleeve Woodcut Dome T-Shirt

not cheap.

Always gut wrenching paying so much for a jacket but luckily it is worth it

Style ||| Quality

Light, easy to pack, does what it is supposed to do

Takes a good blow to inflate.

Good strong light, easy to use

Absolutely brilliant product.  I have just come back from a walking holiday in Austria and we had a really wet day when it not only rained but we were also walking along a very very wet gorge, through streams and puddles and my feet were completely dry at the end of the day.  Couldn't believe it.  My boots are pretty old and haven't been waterproofed since I bought them so I wasn't convinced the product would have much affect but I was totally wrong.  Would definitely recommend it.

Body length, Cuffs

Some dirt didn't come off during washing.

The way it is put together, the quality of the stitching and the overall quality of the jacket is way beyond any other brand I’ve used.

Warm and good quality

Extremely comfortable and waterproof walking shoe.

Smooth movement of the housing. Easy to read off the scale.

tough, hard, reliable and stylish

The gas burns when ignited, always a bonus.

Light and true to size

joint on the folding leg could be better

I like the valve and pouring spout which seems very safe

Slim and comfortable- don't even notice it's on once fitted.

Rather short in leg

The airflow works.

Very smart

Looks good. Warmer thicker than expected. Quality. Rab.

Vegetable Curry & Rice

Easy to cook,tasty and ideal when camping

e+Lite 2 50L Headtorch

A bit tight around the ankles, but easily sorted with some longer laces.

No complaints

Love the fit and the colour

Used on sea kayaking bivi weekend, gets to boiling point very quickly. Took along dry kindling to get started. All in the group were very impressed with speed an effeciancy. Great for one night camps and day trips.

Comfortable light weight stylish!

the price

Expensive for what it is; after all, it's only a pair of leggings. I have purchased two pairs purely for the fit but wouldn't consider the product as representing value for money - even with my 15% discount,

really warm and lots of pockets

Lovely colour combination. It is easy for kids to get themselves into.

Cost

Womens Durban GTX Shoe

Compared to 2012 model it's features, such as exterior chest pocket & different (not as good) liner.

Cut snug but not tight. ||| Pockets good depth and secure. ||| Ankle adjustment ||| Cordura reinforcement present but not obtrusive

Comfort

Too soon to say about value for money - the laces are round - I prefer flat ones as they don't slip

Kids Herbie Jacket I.A

Good price

They fit me very well after good range of size options

Well made and good looking top to wear around town or out in the country. Excellent value.

Womens Aphrodite 2.0 Capri

Tay 300 Tent

Price is a bit steep.Sock in shoe is very thin

Lack of colours available.

Most comfortable and long lasting trousers on the market using them since 2005

Would like adjustment on hem

Drawstring broke but Cotswold quickly replaced entire jacket

It smells very strongly of alcohol and is relatively pricey. Having said that- it should last quite long and the alcohol evaporates quickly.

-Easiest to use spirit-burner ||| -Can simmer ||| -Good fuel consumption ||| -No priming needed, just throw a spark in the centre compartment ||| -Very easy to fuel ||| -No need to defuel; the burner can be sealed with a full tank ||| -The wind doesn't put the flames out ||| -Brass, so it will never corrode ||| -Alcohol (bio-ethanol) can be bought for very low prices in bulk. It works out much much cheaper than using gas canisters or even a liquid fuel stove with naptha-type fuels. Only cheaper fueled stove is a woodgas stove, or a Primus omnifuel running on paraffin.

It's relatively expensive for what is essentially a file. However, given the cost of buying new ice screws or the inconvenience of sending them away to get sharpened it's pretty good value.

Soft material. Very compact.

Fits well but roomy and cool for the hot weather.

Comfortable and suitable for longer walks

They are very expensive.  I only purchase them when they are on special offer.

Very helpful young man who found the shoes for me

All you need for a Duke of Edinburgh Award trek.

let you know if I come across one

Comfort, fit and durability.

The belt is a but fiddly.

Great cheap beginner set of climbing shoes. Ideal first pair.

Breathable fabric against skin and flexible fabric for movement. I reallg like the soft, loose fit that prevents chaffing. Folds up small. I am using these for a 100km trail and training and so far a good piece of kit. I will be buying other pairs.

Very comfortable and surprisingly stylish fir functional clothing

A little pricey

Excellent  product

I use these as work trousers. Comfortable fit. Great in all weathers. Love the zip-off function to remove bottom of leg to turn them into shorts

Good solid sole. Sturdy, leather looks good. Sole is still flexible and gives the feeling you could walk all day in them. Very comfortable for my feet.

Very light but still warm and cosy.

Very comfortable and did the job, stopped a blister getting worse and seemed to heal quicker

They appear to be waterproof so far. ||| They aren't too heavy. ||| They have good grip. ||| Not too manly even though they're grey, because they have a bit of colour on them and they're not too clumpy looking.

Very good for walking in all weathers and UK Hill walking. |||  ||| Do not wear in tough aplpine rock and scree.

Lightweight and comfortable.  Good brim for sun cover.

Mens Wicken Fen Trouser

3 seconds to put up, 60 seconds to peg down. Super quick and easy.

Very high quality tent with spacious sleeping inner for 3/4 people with an even large porch

the sizing chart measurements are misleading.

Laces were a bit short.

Very comfortable with my own insoles instead of the ones which were in the boots. Easy to clean.

Really good support, great for a workout or walking super comfortable

cheap laces

No bad points.

Good compact size.

It’s very useful as an  extra layer

Easy to use. It's been so dry since I bought them they haven't been tested to any extent but appear well made and comfortable

Soo comfortable. This is my second pair - I walked hundreds of miles in the first pair without any foot problems or discomfort, whatever the weather. ||| So it was a no-brainer,when the first pair was retired for gardening, to go back and get the same again.

It worked!

Womens Whistler Fleece

Lovely and comfortable fit

Did not keep hands warm. Caused sweating which made hands cold and damp. Over priced.

Sliver Sunglasses

Very compact and light when folded. Comfortable with head rest and gentle rocking motion as the frame flexes.

Tenacious  Sealing & Repair Tape

Ascent 500 Sleeping Bag 2018

Terraquattro 3P Tent 2017

I don't like the fact that you have to UNDO the laces to put gaiters on. Why doesn't someone make gaiters for boots that have a lace hole at the front of the boot. I know it makes them look good but PLEASE think of FUNCTIONS.

Right size

No breaking in period and comfortable from the word go.

The stretchy fabric added warmth to my sleeping bag without tying me up in knots. And being light is an added bonus

it is a large mat which could be a good point

All Good

Kept me dry walking from Glen Coe to John O' Groats in wet showery weather

Tad expensive but bought in the sale so didn't mind paying that price

K Traa Sjolvsagt Capri

A minor detail but I hike with poles and so the calf cinch will often hit my poles.  Would be nice if there was just a small look to tuck the cinch behind and keep it from flapping.

Smart coat at a very good price

Power Gas 450g Cartridge

Very good fit to my foot shape. Feels like a slipper.

Easy to use and very effective

A less girly colour would be nice.

Womens Bhutan MFS Boot

Powerful dual flame lights things very quickly

Keep fingers away from the flames. ||| Lightweight compared to a cigarette lighter.

Like full leg zip

Silk Liner (Mummy)

Great school sandal

Simple, straightforward, easy maintenance, lifetime warranty.

The harness is very lightweight. I haven't used it outdoors with gear on it yet but on the wall it is very comfy and easy to use.

Love the shoes, there is plenty of room for my feet to move but well fitting enough to hold my feet firmly. ||| The footbed is an excellent fit and cradles the heels.

Minor problem with the pouring function

Bought because of the Gortex waterproofing but it hasn’t rained yet!

Very good fit and very comfortable ||| Well balanced

I'm yet to test these on a long hike, but so far they feel solid and comfortable. They're also very attractive for hiking boots, which is an added bonus.

The price was very good. ||| Stood up to a tough few walks in the Lake District with damp conditions well.

Very lightweight.

Felt like I had to tighten the shoe several times during the day to stop it "floating".  Lace and tongue design make it quite hard to get good grip on laces along the length of the shoe, which means tightening relies on a good hard pull from the top lace hole which may have an impact on longevity - only time will tell.  Once set correctly the shoe felt fine.

Very comfortable straight out of the box and don't require much (if any) breaking-in.

Lightweight tasty food

Good discreet colour; strong, lightweight and durable.

Sleeves to long for me.

Comfortable, but note I am using my own foot beds. The ones that came with the boots are thin and flimsy for the price of the boots. Waterproof after 2 episodes of Alpine rain.  ||| Note; fit with care, because they are for people with bunions the toe box is generous.

Really comfortable walking shoes

Pack small, handy when needed.

used different insoles for a better fit, this is my usual practice for me.

We bought bright blue. Lovely colour. This flask does its job perfectly. Keeps our hot drinks or soup piping hot. Great!

They are wide and comfortable to ware all day

Womens Kiwi Pro Stretch Convertible Trousers

Love the 8.5 sizing. Great fit for my narrow slim foot. I am a size 8. A slight give having worn them once but this just makes them more comfy. This is  a good start shoe. The lacing is great because you can have them as tight as you want.  I have a high arch and find them a great fit. I Like the colour combo too. Think you can get these in blue. . Way better in the blue .

Sizing inaccurate. Bought equivalent of ladies shoe size 5.5 and foot length very tight. Much more care needed with washing compared with another type of Bridgedale socks that I have bought in the past that have been machine washed, tumble dried and lasted about 5 years.

Its very soft and light weight

Very comfy and stretchy

Messy to apply but that is part of the process!

Love the chest pocket. Ideal for mobile phone.

Performance affected by low temperatures ( I was prepared for this)

A bit tricky to get fitting right - had to stop to readjust a couple of times. I would recommend trying out on an easier walk where you can "road test" safely!

Double ended fly zip is an interesting feature, warm and good fit zips on all pockets. So good I bought a second pair

Great pockets

None. I went back and bought another pair!

It's long! ||| It compresses very well

Spirit VCR Climbing Shoe

Quality and Value

Good flavour

Powerfuel (1L)

question how waterproof it is. ||| Without people in the tent, the outer of new tents (yes we bought a few of them) leaked.

Tastes great, packs down small and weighs nothing and with the design of cooking it in the packet it means you don't have to carry extra pans or tins.

Rock Star Helmet

Best fit best walk ever.

Basic mapping compass, easy to use rotating bezel, clear dial. Ideal for low tech map reading without GPS.

Womens Outline Mid GTX Boot

Tasty and fairly filling. Quick and easy to prepare as you expect.

Adjustable leg length

Comfortable & warm

Weight

No Velcro fastening on the front zip.

Mens Ranger 2 GTX Activ Boot

Only fractionally bigger than the previous size that I bought last year. My son is 45 months. He is quite tall but lean. I bought the 48-60 months size.  It only just fits.  I am hoping it gets him through the winter and early spring.

Womens Atlanta Rainpants

Nice fit, don’t need any breaking in, stylish for walking boots

External pockets not quite deep enough to store gloves safely; glad hood was out when I first tried jacket on - rolling it up makes collar rather bulky and stiff; (discovering jacket has been reduced so soon after I bought it!)

Ankle strap fiddly to loosen off getting in and out of sandal

No.

Little expensive considering you have to buy the reproof ingredients seperate

None compared with a  differnt type of Bridgedale socks bought in the past that have been superb. Was very disappointed with current purchase . Bought 2 pairs. Wore one and returned one.

Mens Canyonlands Hoodie

Wanted a lightweight waterproof coat and this is perfect

Shoe rubs on my heel

Mens Respond Mid XCR Boot

Is a good moisturiser as well as protection without being too greasy.  Easy to apply.  Convenient size for travel.

Womens Terra FI Lite Leather Sandal

These are my second pair.  Pleasantly warm in the colder months.

Touch too short

Do not keep your hands warm or retain any heat

Nice quality fleece, very lightweight and easy to carry in a backpack. Would really like this in a brighter colour ( mine is a navy blue).

This hat was purchased in anticipation of a cruise on a yacht through the Dodecanese islands in June 2017. Not yet worn, but it looks good and the instruction book which came with the hat is first rate.

Even slightly damp hands making putting them on difficult ||| If they are even slightly snug fit they can lead to cold fingers - buying oversize avoids this but then looses their sleek fit benefits

good fitting by staff and advice

The most comfortable Sandel I have ever bought. ||| Offers great support to the front sides of the ankle. ||| Designed to cushion foot and stretch where needed with easily adjustable straps. ||| Has a ridged non slip sole.   ||| I will get a second pair when they become available again.

lightweight

Fit is really good and looks really stylish love them

on a pair a year old, the zip has failed and the buttonhole has frayed

Great value blow up bed that is quick to inflate / deflate. Comfortable for occasional use.

Price a bit steep

Would be good to have a larger sized bottle.

The outer shell is slippery when wet

Womens Saturday Trail II Knee Pants

My favourite bits are the holes in the legs for getting in and out of them. Awesome.

Good build quality, comfortable out the box for long walks. Understated looks appeal to me.  ||| A wider fit than normal Scarpa. I have wide feet with a high instep and have no problem.

Nice colour good fit

lightweight and lots of pockets

only had for month so nothing yet

Very strong ||| Excellent buckle design ||| Does not stretch. ||| Best belt you can buy !

Improves the fit of shoes massively! ||| Super good for shoes where you need a secure fit.

Womens Siren Sport Gore-Tex XCR Shoe

good design, warm

Good fit for me - boots not heavy  but support my feet and ankles

The thumb loops are a bit tight since I have got long arms. I usually wear a size 10 but for jackets a size 12 to compensate for that. Still I wish the thumb loops would be positioned slightly differently as they start to cut in after wearing the jacket for a while.

The lining felt very comfy & warm

Great product...

Colour

Edge Chalk Bucket

Block Chalk

The support and cushioning, brilliant for my plantar fasciitis!

This jacket is so light and easy to pack. It’s also very soft.

Torch is very small for its luminosity. Medium brightness setting lasts 6 hours - Still with good range being highly usable when walking up and down 'walla crag' (lake District) in total darkness. Water resistance and show resistance not tested. Torches produces a pure white light, remains totally cool and feels very solid and premium. Reflector around bulb glows bright green after use (glow in dark) as it absorbs some of the light from the main beam. This is actually bright enough to illuminate your immediate surrounds in total darkness, i.e. usesul for a quick pack check or illuminating zips etc.

Nothing at the moment as I have not been wearing them enough to find any bad points.

Great colour

Great value torch with everything on that you could want.

Womens Spirit Lady VCR Climbing Shoe

Helps keep the light out.ideal for festival camping.

A good fit and warm

Green Footbed

Good products and doesn't come attached with high postage costs for Australia which makes it obtainable. Would definitely recommend and buy again from this company

Very comfortable and fit my feet well.

Gorgeous colour, so comfy I want to wear it all the time. Beautifully warm.

Event Shelter 3.5 x 3.5m (12 x 12ft)

Superb quality, keeps drinks hot for longer than expected. Great seal and also easy to clean. ||| Splendid selection of colours and just the right size. ||| Loved s much, have 2 in each car and 4 more !

Powerful bright light beam that can be adjusted to lower power. Useful red light option. Lightweight and comfortable to wear.

Bought to replace broken one.

Ultralight Insulated Sleeping Mat

Very windproof but without being too bulky. Good, practical glove.

Great support around the heel.

I've used both ascenders for three solo climbs to top of my yacht mast today. They've worked great going up and down, felt very safe.

Too soon  to comment as they have only been worn a few times.

The fixings for the ends of the top shock cord fastenings fell off after only 2  wears.

The darkest setting is still pretty bright! Also I couldn't figure out how to lock the settings yet; not really a major issue though.

Quite expensive but good quality material

Womens Langdale 1/4 Zip Fleece

none so far ill see if it lasts .

Quality piece of kit although I ordered Ladies large in error but gratefully accepted by my Mother !!

Good length of gatier

Fast service

bright red pulls on zips but very minor and can live with them !

The boot is well designed, comforatable and is very well suited to a wide range of walking activities. This new pair allows my old Ranger 2 GTX Activ's to gracefully retire having done well over 3,000 miles of UK walking in Wales, Lakes and Scotland. Just give them some TLC and these boots will become great long-term friends! I've no hesitation in strongly recommending the Ranger 2 GTX Activ for UK walking with occcaisional forays onto the higher tops.

Unfortunately it bubbles or 'pills' around the end of the sleeves and where they rub against the hip area.

Pack size

Even though I followed the sizing questionnaire to assess the correct size for me before purchase, the leggings are very snug. Top is fine. Could just be me carrying a bit of extra weight since Christmas still. Might recommend a larger size to ladies if you carry your weight on hips and thighs like I do. There is no stretch in the fabric.

cheap

warm and comfortable

Excellent for washing my technical clothes

Good fit and leg length perfect.

Stylish, versatile.

The are a great lenses manage the bright light well. They look great too ||| Most of all they're amazing value for money.

Womens Helium 3.8 Warm Zone

Sole wore out in the centre while edge wore out very little. Because of pale shade began to dirty quite quickly like  most shoes used in moorland areas.

Silly zips on the pockets - prone to catching the fabric - hoping they have got it fixed now.

-Little bit bent in on the ankle so does rub a little bit

Hurricane Sunglasses

All good

Extremely supportive and comfortable waterproof boots.

Good colour and shape

Could do with bit more padding and not easy to alter sizing strap quickly

Very light and transportable as well as totally reliably waterproof. Zip in a fleece and t will keep you dry in all four seasons. This is my second Cornice ?

Kendal Mint Cake (White) 40g

Great fit, comfortable and warm.

Elasticated waistband

Worked well on a cycle tour, lightweight and added extra warmth to my 2 season sleeping bag.

Fit, price

None of it

Would love an inside pocket

just wonder how long the lace supports will last

Could include some extra straws,

Figure 8 Abseil Device

Quite a neat fit. I would prefer a little more room but the next size up was too big.

Good clean burn and good seal (MSR Rapidfire)

Could do to be longer from waist to crotch.

They are just a little too high I’m used to the mid boot. Will get used to it.

Seems pricy but is competitive.

Aero Screwgate Carabiner 2 pack

Good head torch with wide range of functionality. |||  ||| Stays in place when running and easy to adjust head strap.

Even lighter would be even better!

Comfy where it should be.

Be better with a hard case.

Being chemical free my hands never itch after a climb which is such a plus!

This is a delivers what it says it will -- a hot drink for four hours.  It stays warm for long after.  Easy to clean and easy to stow away in bags and pockets of a large variety of shapes and sizes.  Robust too  with virtually nothing to break.

Quality and a brand name

Advised to wear these to help my posture when doing longish walks. they seem to help as I don't get lower back pain anymore.

very comfortable so far and feet don't seem to get hot

Only worn it twice then washed it at 30° and ironed it at the number 1 setting in accordance with the instructions and it shrunk so now it is too small so I can't wear it. Very disappointing for the cost of it.

-Relatively low power ||| -Difficult to use in the cold; best keep it on you for a bit, before lighting ||| -Although the wind can't put out the flame, it does affect boiling time badly due to the low power. A windscreen is therefore necessary (if not used with the trangia system) ||| -Pot stand is necessary (if not used with the trangia system)

The waterproofing worked completely in the pouring rain, but I only tested it for a few hours. It survived the muddy terrain of the Inca Trail easily. It has good ankle support, and didn't need much wearing in. They also look great, compared to most hiking boots.

Great colour, good fit to size, light weight and full zip gets my tick of approval!

Pasta Bolognaise

Warm and snug.

Good fit, kept trousers dry and clean in wet and muddy conditions.

Easy to set up. ||| Good material. ||| Very water proof. ||| Spacious tent. ||| Inner tent has a ground cloth to attach to the edges of the tent, so guaranteed dry feet!

Like the fit

Lovely and cosy.  Nice and long so covers your bum.

These boots are amazing, I wear them every day , when I walk my dog. I am 92 years old, and could not do without  these boots, as they are so comfortable, and support my feet so well, I am able to walk at least an hour a day in them. Also,for the last two years I had the same boot from you,  and when I had to renew them last month, it took no time to walk them in !! I am comepletly satisfied with my boots, and I tell everyone about them ! ||| N

Good quality  ||| Nice and warm  ||| Got them in the sale

Used in anger in the Brecon Beacons the other week with driving rain and snow and 50mph winds. Kept my perfectly dry and wind proof.

A little thinner fabric than expected

Good fit if a little tight. ||| Good wicking.

Quality good fit good price good

Breathability?

Galaxy 300 Tent 2018

These keep the wearer very warm indeed - they were extensively tested this winter on Dartmoor - and I was very happy with their performance

No not really.

Hard to use with gloves on.

They are so comfy - didn't need wearing in

Bought this in the sale for half the prize. My son loves it and it keeps him warm during the cold winter days. Can't have enough fleece tops for kids.

Good fit and wear well ||| extremely comfortable ||| value for money if  you get them in the sale! but for good allround socks these are worthwhile.

Very light and windproof

Mens Tech Lite Short Sleeve Crewe

Womens Paclite Pants

It warm and light to carry

Can’t help thinking all coats of this range are overpriced

Gave these boots a really hard first test on the broken limestone mountains and cliffs of the far east of Crete, and they passed with excellent marks!  Immediately comfortable, great grip on difficult surfaces (very rough rock, scree, gravel).  For a lightweight boot, good support and the right balance between rigidity and flexibility.  Very pleased indeed.

Really comfortable

Very light, minimalist design, ie no frills to speak of, seems waterproof enough, good for summer use when you need a waterproof but don't want to lug a full blown jacket around

Climbing Brush Set

Very warm quickly, very waterproof even in the wettest conditions.

Too easy to hit the full beam switch on the side by accident if worn on the head but, for me, the good points far outweigh this.

Drink does start to cool if opened up more than a couple times.

Plenty of room inside sleeping area and porch

Soaks in to the leather well, but also leaves a good visible waterproof waxy coating.

Really easy to keep clean and does NOT leak in rucksack

The main downside of this air bed is that it is just too narrow.  It may be ok for a small child.  ||| I had to buy the double one to get a half decent night's sleep.

Very light weight and fit well

Good for hillwalking and general every day activities.

Have used a fair bit now and nothing has come to light

Nothing bad about these socks, just wish I'd bought more pairs!

ProLite Sleeping Mat Regular

legs loop slide down when you are walking round but that's a given as the leg loops are not very tight.

Does not smell even after days of use skiing - great colour and shape

A NICE SNUG FIT

Was not available in any other colours, it is frustrating to see so many other people wearing same shoes - in same colour!

It fits..

Anti Blister Stick

The rear pocket has Velcro and would be better with zip chance for stuff to fall out

These fit really well and look good. The elasticity enables me to climb over rocks and stiles with ease. I wore them on a hard walking holiday in the mountains and they were superb being cool and comfortable whilst looking and feeling good. I ordered myself a second pair.

Easy to use

all of the hat is great

Light, comfy, good soles, water proof

that it could have had a couple more smaller pockets --for a cell phone, music player.. without cluttering up the look

it would have been better if it had loops at the ends of the sleeves for an under fleece

Really comfy and lightweight - incredibly supportive, and still comfortable after a full day's walking.

An excellent comfortable light shoe, wares well, this is the third pair of this make and model I have bought and walked many many miles in them, a first class product.

Fits well nice slim fit . Colour very nice

Kids Mtn Attack 2 Low Shoe

I have been overseeing the management of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme for nearly 20 years and during that time the Trangia has proved to be a trustworthy and valuable piece of equipment.  It's compact, fairly lightweight and very sturdy.  The Trangia has certainly proved its worth to us over the years and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to prospective buyers.

but the sizing was all wrong too small

Nice colours. Comfy.

Not really a bad point but more a query. ||| My Berghaus fleece fits into the inter active jacket zip comfortably. On the jacket there are internal loops to attach to corresponding loops on a fleece so that the fleece stays in the jacket when it is taken off. However I cannot see a fleece on the market that has these sleeve attachments.I have contacted Berghaus and they say they do not have any in their range.

Need a better belt

Stylish rugged good looks!

I am between a 41 and 42. There is no perfect boot and you have to find one that suits your feet best. I wear these boots with a thin sock under a medium weight one. You Tube has several helpful videos on different lacing techniques to hold the foot firmly in the boot. Worth watching.

Pack down small and so lightweight you don't know you are wearing them

USED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE , IT'S VERY GOOD

The only downside is no care instructions, so I'm going to spray them with a leather protector so they will last longer.

Condensation on the inside of the roof. Whats that about?

Seams already undone in places after 7 nights use. Slippy fabric, if you get out during the night, it rucks up in the sleeping bag, making it hard to get back inside quickly, without having to totally rearrange

Very comfortable, soft and stretchy, good range of movement.

Floats

Works with Lake District midges - not bothered at all.

Lovely and warm even in strong winds; more shower proof than expected. Really cosy.

It is very warm. The second one in this style l have bought.

good fit in trainers.....does what it says on the box

It works and lasts.

Comfortable and hardwearing.

Groundsheet not totally sewn in to the whole tent. Can be unclipped outside the inner tent. Saves having to make it messy with muddy boots.

Easy to use and does what it's supposed to do.

Easy to use and enough support to provide a comfortable nights sleep

Strong and light

Good strong elastic

Comfortable stretch fitting

Comfortable. No need to break them in.

Unisex?? Purchased a ladies  small originally. Fingers were too long

There is a touch of the crisp packet about them - but not too bad.

Comfy, great fit

Munro SA+ Ice Axe

It is a really good tent for the price. Comfortably fits one person plus kit as there is both space inside and in the porch. It is easy to put up and withstands hard rain (tested in a thunder storm). I particularly like the the fact that the inner hangs a long way from the fly so there are unlikely to come into contact.  |||  ||| Decent weight for the price as well.  |||  ||| I think they have changed the pegs from earlier versions because mine were pretty sturdy.

The single button is hard to find with gloves on. It could be a little more prominent

I have plantar fascilitus and my foot isn't painful at all when I walk as the base is cushioned so well

They fit. I like them. Trustworthy brand.

Nice soft material makes it comfortable to wear

High cost

Warm & snug and looks good too.

Waterproof and lightweight and very comfortable.

Brilliant for saving space- so have found these cups great for cycle touring and back packing

As I've remarked before about Jack Wolfskin trousers, not really a bad point, but they do come up large. I normally take a size 10, but had to go go down to an eight which is still very roomy!

Mens Lifa Pants

Too long, had to shorten legs

Well put together boot, lightweight but robust.

Really comfortable with good arch support and good padding in the heel.

They are tough and waterproof

The soles were slippery when on wet rock

Wide Mouth 16oz with Flip Lid

They made my sore foot more comfortable whilst hiking

Good strap adjustment system

Leg length shorter than I expected

Handle mounts need deburing

Used similar product in mountain rescue situation  --  was invaluable

It's a bit pricey for the size of canister

Personal Water Filter

Mummy Shaped Liner PC

SOLAR PROTECTION AND COMFORT VERY WELL MADE EXCELLENT QUALITY

Feels lightweight and supportive. Has a more simple construction and less stitching around where foot flexes so hoping these areas won't wear badly in these areas (as my Merrell Moab shoes did).

Sirius 200 Sleeping Bag Short

Because it it relatively light, it tends to blow up towards the waist in high winds.

It's a bit too hot for a hard pace on steep accent, but that's just the nature of outdoors wear as the weather and the environment can change so quickly,  but most hikers carry a few hats.  ||| Me personally, I just tilted it back and "wandered" on.

Not so far.

Light, comfortable walking shoe. Plenty of room in toe box for wider feet. Nice laces that stay done up.

Womens Chilly Spring Hoodie

I love this fleece so much I had to buy a 2nd one in a different colour! So soft and comfy.  And washes really well.

Very portable when walking. Excellent gas mix for cold weather conditions.

Titan Single Lens Sunglasses

None, the perfect mug.

Expensive [but worth it] - material v thin so does show any extra pounds!

Not so good cold.

Comfortable and compact

Very comfortable and practical

Stretch fabric on knees and seat feels a bit lightweight and vulnerable to wear.

The styling is a bit bland compared to, say Scarpa's equivalent. However Scarpa tend to be a little more expensive and besides which I couldn't find any that fit me properly.

Womens Ultra Lightweight Merino Endurance Sock

Wallnut 1 Anodised

Width fitting for my size was too tight and therefore bought a larger size ,which works ok but would like to be able to buy correct size.

Price. It has grown even more expensive than last year.

Only 3 alloy poles (all the same) to be fitted  very quick assembly.Very well designed. Stood up to 60 mph gales at Cape wrath; no issues.Quality alloy pegs. Would deffo recommend.

Good design and quality

Latok Alpine Gaiter

My second cornice jacket; the first one having done excellent service for over twelve years, finally losing waterproofing in the sleeves. My walking is now largely coast path and moor but the jacket has all the features necessary for winter mountain use if I do get to venture further again. The waist drawstring is a useful heat retainer rarely present in many jackets these days.

The material at the lower back area (beneath the waist line) wears a bit too fast (probably from the contact with the backpack). Nothing too critical though.

Very comfortable. Feminine sleeves

Rugged, waterproof, sporty appearance, colour

This model should have a much broader protective band on the front and above the front of the boot. Scrambling in UK ruins the front.

Inflexible sole gives reduced contact confidence.

Mens Lägerplats Cap

A little on the expensive side but qulity

It worked. As far as I can tell after a few wears.

Kids Fleece Gloves

I bought a pair of these three weeks ago and I've been back to purchase a second pair as for me they are the best fitting and most comfortable ones I've ever bought, so when I've worn out the first pair I've got a second pair to fall back on.

Limited range of colours in store, but that's not about the product. ||| This is an item for use in emergency. No such emergency has arisen, so the shelter has not been deployed for any bad points to be revealed. ||| However, I do not anticipate any problems.

Taste, smells it was like eating a comfort food.

The dry bag is a bit of a waste of time and the strap placed inside the pocket to hold the dry bag, which I didn't use, kept on catching on my mobile phoneand camera.

Mens Ibex Pants

Availability of short length - I don't have to take up :-)

I hve never been disappointed with Merrell shoes.

Only 2 pockets :(

Nothing!!

Nope, brown tastes better than white.

Nevis 200 Tent

Got this to use whilst on wild camping trips and was so impressed with how hot my coffee was after 5 hours that I have been to get 3 more for the rest of the family... my girls use them for school in summer to keep drinks cool and for football training to have a hot drink... i use mine when working, walking, camping... brilliant bit of kit and for the price you can't go wrong

Lack of colour choice, brighter colours would be better

Soft and comfortable. Good fit

Quite pricey.

Not much.

Price a bit high but a great product all the same

Very neat fit

Bit expensive but I think they have been worth the money.

I bought as a reduced item, quite pricey full price

Great colour, goes well with jeans.  The outer of the fleece is a bit windproof and the bobbles in the the fleece make it very warm. The jacket also has two pockets on the inside as well as two zipped pockets.  I really like these as I can put my wallet inside to ensure it is safe when out shopping etc.

Comfortable and supportive

Lightweight. Explorer scouts used it for overnight DofE hike. No complaints from a bunch of 14/15 yr olds.

Waterproof but lightweight

Good advice from store assistant and so easy to use, following instructions

Feels slightly delicate but that's the price you pay for having a lightweight product.

Lacing at the top of the boot isn't quite right.

A little heavy

Small, light and easy to carry. Better to take two smaller canisters than one large one. Fits great with my BRS titanium stove. Got cups of tea and porridge for two in 5 minutes. Still plenty of gas left. Got a YHA discount on it too. Job's a good 'un.

Sometimes you want a larger cannister of gas for longer trips.  Problem is that the larger cannisters do not fit in the Jetboil.  Would like a larger capacity and narrower can.

one slight leak over doorway..waterproof spray shoud fix it...fixing for bottom of curtain just a bit of plastic with a hole in...wont last 5 mins..will replace with velcro...why spoil the quality with such a shoddy fixing..all other fixings(inner tent..doorways etc..are hook and eye type fittings ..very sturdy) why not the curtains?..would prefer centre zip in inner tent instead of a wrap around  but thats just me...

Blister On Toes

I found it cheaper in another shop just round the corner.

Snug , warm fleece and great fit

bit bulky for backpacking but great for over landing.

Would like a bit more rubber toe protection for the leather

Great for outdoor weather no problems here

Not cheap

Not particularly easy to turn into shorts with walking boots on

Womens NeoAir XLite Sleeping Mat

does not heat up while having it under your feet or even just above your toes. It only heats up when it is free from any pressure like when I had it in my bag. so they are no good while having them in your shoes which they are meant to be good for.

Good product, washes well,great value

A bit on the pricey side but the friendly Cotswold staff did a price match which reduced the cost significantly.

The main selection factor for us was safety in any climate conditions during spring, summer and autumn and we love our Vaude Terraquattro because we are sure it won't let us down, the materials and the construction parts are very high quality. The tent is super-easy to pitch (5 min!).  We have pretty enough space for two persons and some extra space to put the rucksacks and other things. Perfect choice for a couple but it might be a bit narrowly for three persons.

Replacement for an older one so I knew the benefits and use it on a regular basis

This tent has no bad points

It does what it says it will do

Warm

Colour is suitable to wear with other clothes.

Fantastic comfortable boot ,very good fit for me

No waist draw string for better fit.

Great support and comfort

Very comfortable. Soft but supportive in the right places

Big and spacious for cubs, scouts and beavers

I have worn this make of trousers for many years and used to always fit well with same size. They seem to now be USA sizes which never fit the same even when ordering a different size.

It's a bit greasy. Could do with instructions and general hand care advice.

Great material.  Nice and stretchy when walking but they don't fall down like others.  Just the right length.  Durable.

Like the shoe cleaning flap and how it fastens underneath to stop items falling out when carrying.

Mens Tarantula Climbing Shoe

not really

Love the stretchy quick drying fabric!

Not over-happy with the side pockets with horizontal top openings which can let the rain in, but that's a minor issue.

good style, light weight, fast drying

The price.

Excellent waterproof protection for Goretex boots.

They appear to be well made, warm and comfortable.

Best socks ever. ||| They keep me warm and fit perfect . Would not do any walks or treks without them.

Small and light in pack. ||| I thought it good value for money. ||| It fits the size of group that I walk with the most. ||| It is a better idea than a bivvy bag in my opinion.

Not as yet

Zephyros 2 EP Tent

Warmer than it seems and the little key pouch is a good idea!

Size

Not really although had it a couple of weeks and there is a pull on the toggle string. Not sure how it happened.

Tight body fit - Hard to layer up without feeling slightly uncomfortable, when material rubs it is fairly noisey, like a crisp packet in the breeze.

Cannot fault it

messy to apply

The sizing is all wrong.  It is nothing like the medium Quest top I bought last year.  It is far larger and I am going to have to return it.  Quality control is poor.

Mens Vortex GTX Shoe

Love the colour and it is so warm and very light weight, the stuff bag will be handy as well - bought husband one for Christmas and he was so pleased with it he encouraged me to get one as well.

Does not self inflate

Small cup

Comfortable boot. Bought these for walking my dog.

Good grip.

Nice fit. Very comfy. Warm. Useful as another layer.

Really comfortable and soft but warm

The poles snap because the radius is too tight. |||  ||| Second. The tent is only suitable for very short people..  |||  ||| Thus cub scouts or scouts. I am 172cm and my feet push  the base and my head is up against the top.. ||| which means the tent leaks at the base.  |||  ||| A little longer with pre bent poles?  |||  |||  This would be a masterpiece. |||  ||| There is no room in vestibule for anything beyond shoes. So pack must stay outside.

Very comfortable and excellent grip.  Great colour!

Fun getting on to it  like a waterbed

These boots were replacements for my old Meindl boots. They fitted / felt just like the old ones! They ooze craftsmanship.

Does the job and easy to use

Pocket is small and can be difficult to locate.

would prefer a slightly heavier material

Lightweight, comfortable from first wear.

No bad points 😊

Stretchy fabric for ease of movement, lightweight & quick drying

Good outer shell for warmer weather and wear with under layers when it gets colder.

This was a gift for my wife and she loves it! ||| She's tall 5'11'' and usually finds that outdoor clothing for women is too short in the legs or arms. This fits perfectly

Mens Cornice II 1/4 Zip Fleece

Not sure if they've made a difference. ||| I mat return them

It poured all day and this coat kept me dry! Worth every penny!!! :D

Light and comfortable to wear, integrated belt.

Quality materials and workmanship

Well made. Like the removable inner lining.

Look good & comfortable to wear

comfortable and supportive

Very comfortable from first wear. Good grip and ankle support.

Nothing I can think of

Did the job it said it would with no streaks on my black jacket.

Would only like a bit more colour in the design! Not really that important!

Not enough pockets - no hidden breast pocket and no collar to fold away hood into.

Brilliant fun gloves for the forthcoming winter!!

A little thin and therefore not sure how long it will last

Good grip sole ||| Good wide fit

Light, quick drying,  reasonable fit and comfy to wear.

Although good value, it would always be good if things were cheaper!

Looks good, feels comfortable

X-Mug

Better looking than many of its competitors. ||| Good ankle support. ||| Needs wearing in.

Comfortable from the first time I tried them on.

Hot coffee in the woods...can't beat it!!!

light weight and good level of water proofing

Bring back the embroidered logo... the stick on logo too soon looks tacky when it breaks down

Not used yet so cannot comment

None so far ..

extremely comfortable and hard wearing; the perfect travel companions!

Good value, sleeps 2 with lots of space.

Ideal for travel with zip off legs

The zip sticks occasionally.

I would rather had a buckle on the main strap as on the toe strap

Ideal for travel but not durable enough for scrambling or more demanding activities.

Wide and high toe box

Compact lightweight easy to use

Great for removing mud.

Great fire starting tool

Womens Peakfreak XCRSN II XCEL Low Outdry Boot

Easy to apply and restores water repellency.

Although yet not used in ernest the poncho is easy to put on when there is a sudden downpour.  Packs to a very convenient small size.  Covers well over knees.  All in all an excellent product.

Laser Compact 2 Tent

Light but very robust  |||  ||| Excellent fit and very comfortable after 7 hours walking

Difficult to rate a climbing shoe for comfort as any climber would know, they aren't meant to be comfortable

It points  north. It's rugged and reliable. Useful Romer scales, clearly  marked numbers. Glow in the dark bits to aid navigation in the dark. Easy to hold and use.

Good

I wore these doing the winter fan dance in the Brecon beacons, minus temperatures, howling winds, hard walking, and they did a great job, never got cold or let the moisture through nor got too hot

Good value axe

I walk about 80 miles per week and these boots are exceptionally comfortable, if a little heavy.

Extraordinarily expensive!

Does the job, waterproofs and protects my boots.

I like the gripping cleat for the laces which allows the lace to be tensioned differently for the ankle and foot. Generous toe box. Very comfortable. Sole has good grip.

Mens Short Sleeve NSE Tee

well designed for all purposes.comfortable to wear and does what it says on the tag,keeps wind and rain out.

Would have preferred more supportive insoles

Even a large is quite small.

An exact replacement for a pair I've worn out over the years

They don't need a zip  Therefore they don't have a zip  ||| They are therefore much easier to put  on and they open at the front with excellent velcro .SIMPLES

Very easy to fit and adjust, only used once so far this winter however pleased with purchase.

Light and Dry Bivi Bag

Because it is Velcro fastened it is easy to get on & off.  |||  ||| Good fit, means I get good grip on the wall.

Men's Evolve II Triclimate Jacket

Button fell off and had to sew it back on after being worn a couple of dozen times

Mens Övik Fleece Hoodie

Would have liked a stuff sack.

Lite 700 Sleeping Bag

Light, comfortable, plenty of pockets, excellent for travelling.

Could do with a bigger capacity

It does not smell. It is not sticky and it works. I was frequently bitten by insects and the bites turned to cellulitis. Since using this product I have not been bitten.

Light to wear.  Look smart. Comfortable and warm and dry so far.

Looks good and feels nice

Having had three pairs previously and found them perfect for both everyday use and also Hill walking it was an easy decision to replace them with the same type. ||| I like the new grey colour, the previous ones were brown.

Love this coat, fits well, looks great, really comfy. Ideal as a mid layer in the winter, but I think I will get most wear out of it spring/summer.

Very comfortable, lightweight but still feels structured and supportive, have walked many miles in my previous pair and liked them so much that I have just bought another pair as a replacement.

This is my second pair. I owned the first pair for over ten years. The only reason I had to buy a new pair was I ripped the first pair which was my own fault.

good value

These shoes are so comfortable. I've worn them every day to walk my dog, including several long walks. They are so light to wear, but also supportive.

Great to wear anywhere, 4th pair and had the previous ones for years.

Lightweight but warm basic mummy style sleeping bag stuffs away easily into sack

They are so comfortable and I have quite wide feet so it came as a surprise.

No bad points

Well made, comfortable, quality foorwear

It is a different construction and knit to the average fleece and is very warm and not too heavy,also it seems much more windproof. I also like the breast pocket - very handy for glasses etc.

I have only briefly tried the glasses so not in a position to give an opinion.

They are keeping my feet dry

Slightly restricted headroom when sitting

Bit pricie but I hope we get good value from them before she grows out of them

Bit heavy .  Not really good for three man ten bit of a squish squash and a squeeze. But ideal for 1 or 2 people.

The coat has not yet been tested in wet weather so no verdict given

only had them a couple of weeks , so far no complaints

Monta Rosa New Classic Crampon

Ellipse Bowl

Could do with some silicon fell on both sides to prevent movement on tent base and sleeping bag slipping off particularly if pitched on a slight slope.

Very comfortable because of the stretch material - reasonably rain proof and warm

This is exactly what my 14yr old has been wanting. The quality of the material is fantastic excellent buy especially when I managed to get it at a fab price..delivery no problems and on time...

Due to the lack of drying agents you have to top up your chalk A LOT so it runs the bag down pretty quickly, though this isn't a major issue as there's a lot of chalk to go through!

Light weight walking shoes  - not heavy and clumpy.  Comfortable from day one.

Warm, wind-proof and water-proof! Nice fit.

Very comfortable, don't know how they will wear over time.

Pitching can be a bit finicky. If not set up properly, the rain cover may touch the inner mesh and cause dripping.

Keeps drink hot/cold for good length of time.  Convenient size for carrying and fitting in car drinks holder.  Easy to clean.

Boys Moab FST Low Waterproof Shoe

The pole snapped on day one of a 21 day backpaking trip! Very dissapionted.

Stylish as well as practical.

Awesome build quality and amazingly comfortable.

Warm comfortable from first wear and waterproof.The first time I used them l wore them for about eight hours  and they were really comfortable  and supporting.

Excellent value and quality, warm and light.

As the norm RAB products are excellent but what really helped was your salesman , please excuse the spelling if this is wrong ( Meiron)? . Obliging , helpful, he went the extra mile, my partner is 5/5.1 and struggles to find walking pants to fit her. Meiron your bloody brilliant ,she's never out of them and it's fantastic following my girl up the hills . Cheers Cotswold and RAB.

Wish they made them in larger sizes...400 and 500ml

Nothing so far.

They are very comfortable and neat looking. I've used them a lot and not had any rubbing or blisters! Love them.

Practical and fashionable

a bit long and not so keen on the drawstring bottoms ||| Columbia not/rarely  available in store

Bothy Bag 2

When the gas ran out I tried refilling it and it stopped working. The gas was full but it would not light/spark

Waterproof Cream 100ml

The first time pitching hook on the ground sheet of the inner tent broke.

Comfortable. Just fit my size 8 feet.

Lovely soft feel. Colour very pretty.

Had my first pair of these shoes 6 years ago and they have been brilliant. Just hope these new ones turn out to be as good in the long term.

It won't stay unfolded when you lay it out on the ground.

Have used a handful of times over 2 months travel and they already have holes in. Would not recommend

It actually works!

Bought as a present for my husband, but he has found them very comfortable even on a long day out around Edale.

Expensive but Nat Trust 15% discount certainly helped.

Zip has tendency to snag, but no real issue, just need to be careful.

Womens Terran Lattice II Sandal

Good body length ||| Tapered fit ||| Underarm vents ||| Compactness

Nope!

Freight Hat

A bit pricey, but you get what to pay for.

Would have liked an extra pocket in the thigh area.

Giving that it needs to rubbed it your hands, it's not something you could use in the same as chalk from a chalk bag. You can on apply at the bottom of a wall before you climb.

Womens Cyrus Mid GTX Shoe

Very warm and comfortable -wide, flat elastic waistband does not dig in at all

This is my second pair of these trousers, I now have a pair in blue as well as green they are very versatile as you  can wear them 3 ways - full length trouser, cropped above the ankle or shorts . I always take them away when I holiday in the UK as they cover all weathers! ||| I purchased both pairs in the sale as they are a little expensive full price.

Kids Splosh III Suit

Very comfortable waterproof boots. My second purchase of this model

Maybe better choice of colour.

Great, very light also very small product. Ideal for summer nights or indoor stay

Spectre 2 Quickdraw Set 12cm Dyneema

Aero Screwgate 5 Pack

Up and down in a hurry, no problem.

Trangia Spirit Burner

Not much insulation, narrow.

Womens Merino Hiker Sock

Warm, soft and keeping it's shape

nope

Come up a bit small.

Very light   easy to wear

Nice colour

I have had Meindl boots before and they are comfortable from day one , I have never had blisters or callouses or the need to use compede with these boots , and would not hesitate in recommending them . I walk with three others and all but one wear the Bhutan boots .

Easy to put on, comfortable to walk in.  Waterproof and lightweight.

No frills, but not wanted and that kept down the cost

Excellent to have size 9 ladies boots in a narrow fitting. Heels well held when walking down steep slopes. Good grip on loose stones and in damp conditions. Dried overnight and not excessively sweaty.

Keeps kit working well - easy to use

Fiddly zips

There is nothing that I don't like about the jacket

NOTHING

Fleecy mcfleece face

I like how the socks are made in specific sizes for ladies with small feet. They stay in place well without being tight around the ankle.

The fleece's price is what I consider to be quire high.  However I got the fleece in Cotswold Outdoors' Black Friday sale with 20% off so this made the fleece more reasonable.

Seems a good design

They damaged very easily and tore on sharp rocks

Nope !  Light weight & very useful

Thick, light and compact- looking forward to testing it out on a multi day hike

Nothing yet.

Soul 200 Tent

Great material- very warm and attractive texture unlike a lot of other fleeces

Colour Fit Comfort

Nothing. Given 9s as only had them a short time and durability unknown.

Ideal in the jungle

Great fitting piece of clothing that feels and looks fantastic.  ||| Being a Rab item of clothing It is an item that  will not let you down at that crucial moment.

Nice size and easily stowed in a running pack

Good hood & weight

I used in trangia, no soot on pan bottom :)

I used them to do a nightshift outdoors and it was freezing but they kept my legs nice and warm !!

Only worn it twice so far, but the zip seems a bit cheap & sticky, not smooth.

Good tough grippy sole able to get purchase on narrow rocks and remain comfortable.

The sizing is not very accurate

Looks good.

The pourer isn't always the most reliable and can chuck the liquid in different directions. Not a massive problem as I just take the lid off and pour it like normal.

The low rise waist was so uncomfortable, I didn't see anything in the description about low rise or I wouldn't have bought them. Very disappointed.  Going to take them back to shop for refund, hopefully, as I have removed paper labels!

Very comfortable, easy to maintain

a bit bulky around the ankles but this is to be expected.

Comfort and fit are very good. Well positioned pockets. Weather protection

Womens Evolve II Triclimate Jacket

Good fit and very adjustable.

Nothing not to like

A bit expensive, but you know it’s a quality item.

Material feels great. Articulated cut ensures well fitting shape. Sizing seems accurate.

Not found any yet

Extremely comfortable.  Did a lot of long distance walking and no problems.

Packable.

Very comfortable and supportive. Waterproof

Great fit in my HanWag boots

Only just bought it for trip to Iceland, everything spot on !

Lightweight and slim fitting with no bits n pieces sticking out. only used on snow so far and they worked fine. Can't comment on a wet rainy days use yet.

Women's Merino+ 120 Long Sleeve Tee

rainwater can collect near the doors, so needs to be cleared before entering/exiting to avoid a wet back.

A shame the battery conversion pack only produced 40% recharge power. This should be made clearer

Really soft comfortable fabric

Really good foot support

Flame is awesome

Very light weight and good quality for the money

I bought these boots for low level walking on the North Downs, as I don't need a Mountain boot I decided to go for something that would suit the terrain that I walk in. They are very light and comfortable . The vibram sole maintains good contact in muddy conditions. Iwalk about 20/25 miles a week so how well they wear remains to be seen.

Have to open completely to drink - it would be better if you could drink the contents without completely removing the lid. A cup lid would improve things

Waterproof and a good fit.

Great stretchy feel

A very comfortable walking shoe i could walk miles in these

Mens Pack It Overtrousers

Amazing stuff, walked 85 miles over 3 days and didn’t get one blister. Can not recommend this enough!

Womens Manaslu Jacket

Slightly sloppy stitching: quality control could be a tad better.

Great harness + starter bundle

Great fit & length, handy pockets. ||| Very comfortable. ||| So good I have 3 pairs.

Easy to use and so far seems to work. Brushed my Montane Atomic against a barbed wire fence creating several holes in the sleeve. Tape sealed them up quickly and two hill runs later still holding together.

I am working them in and expect this to take a good month or so. Tell me if I should get some thicker socks for the use with the Boots please.

Only last about 12 months

The Renegade actually costs more in Australia, and I actually saved money buying it online from Cotsworld, but it is still on the expensive side.

The good fit

Insufficient adjustment for the hood

Works as anticipated. Great sevice

Light-weight, comfortable from first wear

Womens Latok Alpine Gaiter

Could be supplied with some racking carabiners

To be fair it was the price.

Mens Merino+ 120 Short Sleeve Tee

Lightweight & comfortable

Very light

Superb comfort straight out of the box

Washes anything a great all round soap

Must be no oily residues on skin to have fool proof adhesion.

Crush Lace Climbing Shoe

Good cover. Nice and long.

putting them on for the first time and walking off into the hills knowing that they were comfortable and reliable from the start

Excellent waterproofer. Handy size spray action bottle. With a little bit of practice you can achieve an even finish,getting into the hidden parts that otherwise would be missed by using a cloth.

Extremely light and comfortable.

adequate size

Warm, lightweight, looks good, can be worn by itself or as a layer.

Super light and comfortable,

Vegetable Chipotle Chilli with Rice

Side panels cost extra.

Knife and Spork Set

Light range is very good, expecailly for monutain walking

On/off button is not very easy to operate as it is flush with the bottom of the torch which means you need to push it further into the torch.  If it were slightly raised, it would be easier.

Toe Warmer

Easy to carry for camping. Good quality and design

Womens Kinetic Plus Jacket

None!

Normally wear size eight boots, had to go up to size nine for these, but it's a minor quibble.

comfortable from the start and look well made.

Comfy nice design very warm

Quite expensive.

When slightly warmed enters, softens and protects full grain leather

Mens Benny Polo

The lighters often had issues sparking or holding a flame, usually when it was cold, wet or when you really needed it. These are the 3rd pair I've bought and all three pairs have had the same faults. I won't be buying them again.

Could do with a larger leg pocket.

Because the uppers are so comfortable and soft, the boots feel they are a lose fit. I don't know if this will be a problem on rocky terrain, etc. as yet.

When collapsed it's very slim and fits into the fullest packs. Sides are tall and stops the food falling out and the base is a sturdy chopping board for prepping your meal.

A shame you need 2 products to wash and proof, it makes it a bit expensive, how about a 'Wash and Go'?

It's a shame that the main pockets have vertical openings, which decreases their usefulness as you have to be alert to things falling out

Ultra-Fine Mesh Head Net

Very good fabric and black dye. Well cut.

Fits like a slipper

Be conscious that these trousers are reasonably fitted through the leg. I wanted this feature given many lighter trousers seem to be baggy, but the fit may not be right for all people. There is sufficient room at the ankle to comfortably fit a heavy boot though.

Love, love, love these mitts and can't wait for some cold weather. I keep trying them on as they fit so well. ||| Lovely soft leather and nice and cozy inside with the fleecy glove liners. ||| Great price in the sale! ||| Also, I am usually a small in gloves but after looking at the size guide I opted for a medium, which are perfect and fit like a glove (pardon the pun)

Great fit, lovely feel to the material, flat seams throughout.

Everything good  ||| Thanks

Easy to apply.  Rubs in well.

Pockets would be great !

xx

they dont scratch when you lay them down as the rim protects them, and really sharp vision.

Well Made, durable and strong

In my opinion this tent can fit three small people without all their stuff in or two normal size people with their stuff.

Heats up water well,  uses various fuel sources.

Hood needs a visor or similar

Great fit and comfortable , also quick drying.

Mens Respond GTX Shoe

Not bulky, look smart, mobile phone use is possible with them on.

Comfy, roomy, fit the sleeping bag well, stayed smooth.

The hood adjustment is a pain

Overall very good for this type of seat.  Good price in sale when 2 bought.  Only scored lower as not as comfortable as the more padded versions.

Arms are only just long enough.

Mens Santiago Pants

Like the edging around neck, sleeves and around the bottom.

Nice sturdy shoe. Easy to take on and off.

Really spacious inside with plenty of space in porch for gear. ||| Quick and easy to pitch ||| Good price vs quality+weight

Love all the pockets

Light low cost and does the job

Waterproof and good walking platform.

Easy to use and very effective.

I wore the walking shoes yesterday for the first time walking 8 miles in the Yorkshire dales . They were very comfortable and gripped well in the muddy terrain !

Third one I have had over the past few years. These are regularly worn on an almost daily basis and are excellent. Another useful feature is my Berghaus fleece is compatible.

Keep me lovely and warm

It does what the label says and does not interfere with waterproofing,breathability, ||| or fabric softness.

Always buy Meindle as I have a wide foot and these boots are comfortable.

Stylish looking fleece, nice fit, lovely soft feel and I like the colour.

Really comfy and I love they drawstring in the waist to make an awesome fit

sizing doesn't come up that big.  4 year old son, who is slightly short for his age and 4-5 yr old suit fits well but not much growing room.

Liquid Chalk

Staff was helpful, been trying boots at home ,still to hit the hills and long walks.

Nothing!

Comfortable, glad to get it half price. It washes great too.

Nice and warm. Well made and a perfect fit.

Not yet.

Comfortable , warm

I wanted this flask to carry a hot coffee on winter bike rides but when pre-heated with boiling water and carried in an insulating sleeve it will only stay at normal drinking temperature for around an hour. No better than my cheap wide mouth flask.

Hood is a bit on the large side

The silicone is easy to apply and works well.

Woukd be overpriced if didn't have discount card

Price

Wide around toes (important if you have bunions or wide feet).

The socks fit well, are really warm and are not tight around my legs which I often find a problem.

Cheap and cheerful

Fabric is a bit flimsy once clipped in, could be a little longer to reach jean loops

Mens Cirrus Flex Jacket

Good comfortable fit. Great secure pockets. Wear them all the time for walking and as casual.

Could have bought a size bigger

Looks good, I like the fit of Jack Wolfskin jackets

Additional pockets would be great

Well finished off

No cord to secure hat in wind

lightweight and bent very easily - not long enough to work effectively.

no.

They only do them in black but sell blue coats

Extremely roomy with good sitting height. I'm 6'5" tall and many tents slope up so gently that longer inners don't allow me to stretch out without my feet pushing into the side of the tent.  No such problems here.

Light and easy to wear

Nice and warm

Very comfortable, as all my previous Merrell shoes have been.

Second pair: ||| Long term comfort ||| Still waterproof after 8 years

Well made and comfortable. ||| Quality product!!

Comfortable, Waterproof, Good Support.

Easy to pack, works!

raise the groundsheet to be more of a bathtub design.

Cumfy fit

Great fit, lovely material, really comfortable to wear.

No brake in required, very good

Light and warm

Good grip

Good Fit.  Very light and comfortable, yet warm.

They squeak with every step I take which is very irritating.

Mens Moab 2 Ventilator Shoe

Large area to shelter under for both wet & dry good for events

bought as a christmas present for somebody else because I had used them and liked them.

The touch screen contact points are not the best feature. Hit and miss at best

Would like cargo pocket on each leg

Used on glacier travel fitted well worked well

comfy

Good fit and comfortable.

no bad points

Good product quality, will withstand a shower of rain.  Nice light jacket suitable for an amble rather than serious walking (see below).

Very comfortable and waterproof

Observer Chair

Helps the fit in boots.  And keeps foot lenth consistant sitting  or standing.

Womens Activo GTX Shoe

Lightweight, good fit and very effective waterproofing

Too narrow.  They felt OK in the shop, but a bit uncomfortable since.

No half size

May be too bulky for multi day trips, not sure how it would perform if the fuel were very wet.

Mens Renegade GTX Mid Boot

Nice wide and thick mattress that folds up relatively small given the dimensions.

Only works with camping stoves & butane gas cylinders. It will not light my kitchen hobs running off mains gas. |||  ||| May take several attempts to catch light. |||  ||| Cigarette lighter is more reliable.

Light

It's cosy with sleeves that cover my wrists which I like. They're shaped and fit said wrists snugly. I love the powder blue plus the fleece  skims my figure, without  showing every bulge, which is good. I also really like the asymmetrical hood lacing as it adds style.

Really good boot, nice soft leather meaning minimal wearing in, a comfortable fit for my odd shape feet

Waterproof trail shoes with ankle support. ||| Very light and comfy

Nice socks just not as thick as I would have expected for walking up mountains, particularly at the £16 price tag.

Womens Renegade GTX Mid Narrow Boot

Cool material. Durable. Dries quickly. Non-iron.

Applicator nozzle is useless

Warm. Comfortable. Useful pockets. Even somewhat windproof which I didn't expect.

Would prefer a slightly thicker sole. ||| Heel straps to be very slightly higher to fit over heel rather just below.

Little tight on the hips.

Could do with another zipped pocket

its good got it to light meths stove reliably. i could also refill this one ! i bought one of the older models and it would not refill !!

Very light weight, keeps the wind out too.

Mens Flux 2 Power Stretch 1/4 Zip

Mens Crosstrail Tee

Comfortable. ||| Washed well. ||| Have bought another pair!

The rubber on the sole may be a bit softer than some boots but that may be a plus for comfort. My last pair actually wore out through the bottom of the heal of the boot . As is usual its probably more than I would want to pay for this boot but the quality makes the boot last longer than similar boots from other manufacturers

Mens Ravine Waterproof Boot

Womens Redonda Hooded Jacket

Bit warm

None - it works!

Price too high

A small amount goes a long way.

Good light jacket

High neck covering to protect from cold winds. Two outer hand pockets and a good size internal pocket, presumably for maps. ||| Gore tex, so hopefully should protect from heavy rain. Waiting for some adverse weather conditions to test it. That shouldn't be too long as Summer is on it's way. ||| Inter active zip to attach an internal fleece. ||| Manufacturing quality is good.  I have other Berghaus equipment and am pleased with the overall quality of their products.

The quality

Womens Sawtooth Pants

If the base was a bit more non-slip that would be handy.

Womens Quest Pants

Sevilla Chair

Really good fit, good value at half price in the sale.

Good fit good thickness nice and warm

Stood up to strong winds

Not easy to get the flysheet really tight. ||| No pockets inside for storing small items

Ascension Ascender

I would have liked a 7 1/2 size but not available, so, the new shoes are slightly loose, but with a good pair of insoles they are fine.

Not been the weather to use them on a regular basis, but I'm confident they will do the job just fine...

Womens Vital Windshell Hoody

Water proof good looking

good for bike rides, fits in bottle cage

Can be slightly uncomfortable after a long time.

Good size fit, lives up to waterproof standard after knee deep on wet moor

This is my second Tilley and they are extremely comfortable , and practically indestructible. My first hat I have had over ten years and after many washes has kept its shape.

Very good

Great chalk, works well

Womens Midweight Merino Comfort Sock

An excellent walking shoe that's ideal for my feet

Keeps your coffee hot for hours

Wire can get twisted if used by D of E groups which causes gas build up or lack of gas

Taking a long time to wear in properly, problem with rubbing to top of foot and little toe

Easily seen

Ok if you want to keep a hot coffee beside you at your workstation. It could still be drinkable after 3 hours if you pre-heat the flask with boiling water.

Still not good in lower temperatures like in winter. Better using white gas or petrol. Keeping the canister in your sleeping bag overnight helps performance in the morning for a short while.

Tech Wash 300ml

Mens Crevasse Fleece

Good fastenings, light, shorter points.

Comfortable and very easy to use

They're lightweight, but tough, easy to wash and don't need ironing as long as you take them out of the machine straight away.

Good fit and look. Light weight and waterproof.

Great glasses

Not exactly "cheap", but then your feet take a lot of stick so why would you want to put them into cheap socks

No bad points really...maybe a hard instead of a soft case but that's understandable.

Good fit & properly waterproof!

Campfire Cutlery Set

Not used long enough to say but so far so good

Perhaps a little overpriced for a plastic mug

None discovered yet

Still a little bulky but light

Excellent quality, fit well, very comfortable and cannot get my son out of them.

Great comfort and support on long mountain walks in all conditions underfoot

Spot 325 Lumen Headtorch

Slightly noisy when wearing

Quite heavy to transport

Nothing negsative to say

Love this belt. Fully adjustable and locks precisely.

I love this fleece.  It is warm and snug.  It is relaxed and casual.  I do lots of outdoor stuff and like this because the cowl neck is different to those I wear for hiking, biking, skiing etc.  The huge pocket is also useful - I'm a mum so have to stow things for small people who don't want to carry them any more.

Great combination of protection

Would be great I feel there were pockets

Elixir 2 Backpacking Tent 2018

Womens Rab Ascent 700 2018 Sleeping Bag

Lightweight and fully waterproof. Wore them on a long hike across Bodmin Moor in atrocious weather and stayed 100% dry.

Stretch, three leg lengths.

Didn't keep feet dry in a wet camping field

Contour 50:60S Rucksack

my rab hydrophobic down coat is restored to its former puffiness and clean too now. took several tumble drys with lots of unbundling of feathers. But i am back to a lovely clean and warm coat now. Note - after washing it looks like a drowned cat, but it does recover.

Very warm and comfortable

My t shirt shrunk in the wash

The torch reacts to the available light and adjusts the power. ||| The torch can be adjusted and fits very well.

Buying this size is more economical than the small bottles.

Steel Wire Pegs 18cm

Easy to fit to boots

It's a great fit and snugly and washes really well

The ball of my left foot hurts.  Probably a matter of time.

Short in the leg section, could do with being a cm or so longer - for the taller than average woman

Lightweight  ||| Comfortable  ||| Decent length in the body

Easy to use and effective.

Lightweight,yet warm.

Light weight, easy to transport. Good size of foot print base.

very soft and comfortable to wear

Mens Terra Pants

Haven't found anything yet.

Practical and look smart, nice and cool

Didn't wearing in at all

Women's Merino Twinpack

Womens Everyday Leggings

Inflates well, good depth and comfort.  Much better than the air bed that it replaces.

The half litre would have suited but seemed very expensive in comparison

Only used once so far but work well in frozen snow & ice.

I slid off a couple of times, but this may just mean I'm a wriggly sleeper.

Mens Classic Kiwi Trousers

Base Camp Kettle 1.5Ltr Stainless Steel

Good fit and long lasting

Large gates for use with gloves. Pretty light for the size.

Belt is tight in its channel so baggy when not at full stretch.

Really nothing I didn't like except perhaps I'd have preferred a blue as opposed to to purple but that's just a personal thing.  I love them.

Lightweight  ||| Waterproof  ||| Comfortable

The leg length isn't very long on these.

Comfy shoes . Like the colour , water proof . ||| Very happy with them

Nothing really for the price but would be nice to have 2 x hand pockets and a front fly.

Easy to put up. ||| Good quality materials. ||| Folds down to easily manageable size. ||| Perfect for events and gatherings.

Easy to put on over boots. Warm, windproof and waterproof.

Mens Dart T-Shirt

Great value and they look great too.

Better range of colours

Nothing as yet

I bought these for curling They are perfect as they are lightweight but warm and stretch nicely.

Searcher Chair

Could be cheaper but then you get what you pay for!

Very pleasant tasting. I take it bike riding and find it helpful

Mens Nexus Pull-On Fleece

It fitted me !

The central zip is a bit awkward for inserting boots into the bag, especially for the bigger boots.  When you have to push past the zip, the zip tends to catch on the boot.  Not funny if it's covered in mud !

A little more rocker on sole and a little bit stiffer would make them ideal

Slightly long sleeves. Manageable though.

Mens Ascent Overtrousers

Great Flask. My hot water was still piping hot after 7 hours and my iced tea was still refreshingly cold at the end of the day (12 hours roughly).   ||| The flask itself is powder coated so it is hard wearing. The cup is a healthy size and gives you a couple of cups of tea out the flask.

There are no bad points that I have discovered.

Requires 3 AAA batteries, built in rechargeable would be preferable.

Fit and comfort cannot be surpassed.

No bad points as far as I am concerned.

Super fit and comfy. lightweight and waterproof

Easy to inflate, really comfy.

G12 Newmatic Crampon

Very comfortable good grip and waterproof for a year

I erected this by myself which I am proud of as I am a single female.  It stood up to a week of gale force winds and heavy rain, no leaks, I used the storm straps, brilliant. |||  ||| It was easier for me to erect with the inner tent removed.  It's a brilliant tent, I am really pleased with it.  I love the windows with curtains.  :)  The pole holders are an excellent feature.

Bit expensive!

Much better than petrol.

Womens Filippa Beanie

Scored 5 as the outcome varies dependant upon the garment one is washing-treating. ||| Have had excellent results also not such good ones.

Soul 100 Tent

Husband loves it. Its warm, comfortable and washes well. Great value for money too.

Kids Puppet Glove

Does what it's supposed to. Keeps the water and wind out

Comfortable, waterproof

Light weight boots and so comfortable

Happy

May not last as long as I hope due to the softer leather

Waterproof

Leg flaps occasionally catch in venting zips.

Nothing really to tell it's a peg that we needed and it did the job.

Tight around the forefoot but I know they will stretch up.

OmniFuel Stove with Fuel Bottle

Price is a little high but a quality product.

Easy to use and got everything really clean

Ouality of materials

The insole could do with been changed for better comfort and fit there's little arch support in them

Very useful, comfy and not bulky...really happy

-Lovely bright colours ||| -Easy to adjust velcro ||| -Good rubber and shaped sole

Wear day in day out... movement never a problem and all in all the only trousers you'd ever need....

Womens Altus Jacket

Viper 2.0 Harness Starter Pack

Light in weight lovely blue colour

No breast map pocket

Excellent fit and leg length. Very comfortable to wear.

Material is quite thin so not sure how durable it will be.

Comfortable to wear

I love these fleeces.  They are great quality and look great on my OH. I have bought several of these over the years in different colours and they wash well and last well.

Great grip from the vibram sole unit!

Womens Green Lake Zip Off Trousers

Excellent conversion kit for trangia

Good fit, nice material

Excellent. Does exactly what it's meant to

I was very cold as you can't seal the bag in at the top. Also the head section could do with a drawstring. This is a very lightweight product more suited to sleepover's rather than for camping out. I had to wear all my clothes and a fleece to keep warm.

soft, very warm & fits well when layering.

A little on the large size but next size down was a bit small

They're a tad too dark for me so best for brighter days but that's only a very minor point

Comfortable and warm

Trim to fit, so great for a range of shoe sizes.

Putting it back again! Very tricky. Also, the Zips get stuck easily.

Easy to use.

good Quality and warm.

Constructed like a brick dunny, floats, warm but well ventilated, water resistant and quickly dries when wet

Well made and looks good

Protection Pack

I find it keeps my hot drinks hot for the whole day.

the double flame with ease to use.

Good for wide feet

The range of colours is limited. I would have liked a second pair in dark blue.

Can't think of any bad points.

Not many coats nowadays have the map pocket just behind the front zip so I was pleased to find one in this this coat

Yaktrax Hand Warmers

A little goes a long way

Good quality and style.

These are ok, soft and comfy. ||| Good height for walking boots, not too tall but tall enough to prevent rubbing around top of boots. ||| Variety of colours,  not all pink for women! ||| Good cushioning-no blisters after walking 10-14 mile days in them.

TiV Vacuum Flask 500ml

LIMTED SELECTION IN COLOUR RANGE IE ONLY TAN OR A DUSKY BLUE NICE BUT A PALER COLOUR TO REFLECT BACK THE SUN - A BIT BOX SHAPED IN STYLE

Fit was good

Really comfortable.  Very stable.

good all-rounder

Comfy hat that sits well on the head.

It's great to find a garment with extra long sleeves

Very good insole  ||| Service in betwsycoed  ||| Excellent

Fits well, water proof

Navigator Sunglasses

Warmth without weight or bulk

Only used for a few days this winter, but they fit well and the rubber strap underneath the boot looks tough.  This was a deciding factor when buying them! |||  ||| They do the job.  Esp. protecting my lower legs from crampons!

Great glasses that protect my eyes and look great

Gridlock Screwgate Karabiner

Not cheap (tho cheaper than some other Superfeeet insoles!) but I guess you get what you pay for.

Easy to use and effective combined with the other Nikwax products

gortex, nice colour, neat design, hood, fair price for high quality gortex

Not as comfortable as I would have liked.

Comfortable and good for walking dog as have a good grip

1 St door opening in the morning (especially if it rained in the night) usually resulted in water running in off the roof and the door and into the tent. Perhaps the addition of a "ridge line" above the zipped door, to allow the water from higher-up to be diverted?

Not found anything yet. A great product.

Mens 175 Everyday Long Sleeve Crewe Top

Fits like a glove and keeps you amazingly warm when needed

really warm, waterproof & great hood. Plus looks good! ||| Cotswold shop assistant was amazing at recommending this item

Groundhog Tent Stakes (Pack of 6)

So easy to put up

The heel is a bit baggy, which makes heel hooks difficult. |||  ||| (That said, this shoe had the least baggy heel of all the others I tried on.)

Comfortable, good fit, especially like the fact that the legs are close fitting with neat zipped pockets

Good size, the one I used to use was too big, I never even got to the bottom!  Nice range of jazzy colours, unlike the usual black.

Fits very well,nice and long in length

Just love it !

Had two pairs of Scarpa boots before these, the quality remains high!

Kiwi Pro Winter Lined Trousers

Nothing I can think of,it even washes well.

Some of the stitching wasn't great.  ||| Pockets could do with being slightly deeper.

10 out of 10. Just love this tent. And quick and easy to pich in less then 15 minutes. And if it's raining you can pack the inner first so not to get it wet Great size for my Cubs and scouts. We be buying six more

Storm Bivi

I suppose, being pernickety - the cost. And it would be nice if Silva sold these with some sort of hard case to protect them - but this is all something of a 'wish list' - can't fault this kit at all

The lid occasionally can come loose (not when attached to the cup) ... The actual lid comes apart.

An excellent bit of kit

Very nice compound applies easily to my boots

Kendal Mint Cake (Brown) 85g

So far so good, keeps my feet warm and dry, secure footing when surfaces are wet and slippery

I bought these boots due to make and similar model to previous boots purchased.

IsoPro Gas Cartridge 113g

No mess. Easy to use

Comfy, right weight for Autumn and looks smart.

Ellipse Plate

Super for Goretex wear & easy to apply in washing machine

light weight  ||| some female shaping  ||| warm

Reasonably priced compared to other brands.

Three velcro straps allow for a tight fit but you can still take the shoes off quickly and easily between climbs. Advertised as an "advanced all-rounder" - which is a good description of the product. Excellent rock shoes for most types of climbing.

I have tried on walking boots before but never purchased any until this pair convinced me they were worth a try. They are very comfortable from the start and appear to be well-designed and manufactured in every aspect. Hopefully they continue to please as it is still early days.

Room around the toe box and supportive in body of foot

Mens Kiwi Pro II Trousers

Hard to sit up. Not much space around the edge of the tent between inner and outer tent

Sundome Beach Shelter

Womens Vego Mid Leather Waterproof Boot

It is very comfortable and fits perfectly.For this time of year it has just the right amount of warmth,and I have been hill walking wearing my fleece and have rarely left it at home.

Quite neat in size. Had to buy a size up to be comfortable

It folds up very small and is fully waterproof

Very comfy with great ankle support.

Concealed zipped safety pocket

Nothing to moan about..

Light but durable

Good boot, well made

Taste is amazing- quantity just right.

Clean burn , with a fast boil time!

Extremely comfortable from the first time I wore them - only need to ensure you don't tie laces too tight around ankle

Nevis Flex Crampon

Sleeves too long, though I have to say I am only 5 foot tall.

Helios Sun Hat

GOOD SIZE AND VERY WARM

DriStore LocTop Valuables Bag (Set of 3)

One off, easy to use.

Thumb holes would be nice, and a full zip so it's more temperature adjustable.

A decent pair of outdoor walking trousers for the money. Worn then everyday for 2 weeks without any issues.

I like the fact for a small rucksack it has a facility for a bladder, place for walking poles and a good back vent.

Excellent, good quality and work perfectly.

Great comfortable design

In the sale so always a bonus. Good Quality jacket that is highly functional

Mens Viper Hoodie

Mens Traverse Trousers

Pocket openings could be better designed

Slightly large around toe area, so upper presses slightly on my toe when foot is bent. Extra innersole helps with this, and leather is soft enough for it not to cause too much of a problem.

Very comfy and light!

Small, fold well, wide pan surports, light.

Amazing for a warm breakfast in a bag. Wouldn't be without this one!

Grasmere Ankle Gaiter

Material means they slip daily in the slightest of breezes.  Also soak up water

You will never use matches or any other lighter again.

They didn't come with a free tshirt.

Nice design, great fit, very snug but without any pinching or tightness.

Good quality stopper was the main reason for buying this make but overall finish is very good also

Iota Headtorch

Okay it was for fuel and sustenance for a mountain marathon. Lightweight and filling. Ticked all the boxes and tasty as well. . No idea if it is value for money or not.

Don't like velcro for longevity of product. Prefer buckle.

Love these socks so comfortable and warm.  Good value for money if bought when reduced.

Good fit and like the stretch waist.

easy for us to store in our Motorhome storage area, in the case provided.

Excellent quality and price

Wow, at last a pair of gloves that keep me warm :D

Really comfortable lightweight material, with the versatility of trouser or shorts. Perfect for walking and relaxing days.

Mens Nimble Hoodie

Slightly narrow but the alternative would be 15 as they don't do a 14.5.

This is the second coat I have bought, really like the style , nice colour hood great as you can reduce it to fit smaller head.

Good deep zipped pockets ||| Zip-off to shorts ||| Comfortable

Wouldn’t pay full price

A bight on the pinkish side of red.

The comfiest boots ever!

They work as carabiners should

My second pair. Comfortable and grip well over a variety of terrain.

None

Fit is perfect with good support it is what I have come to expect from all Merrill boots

Mens Power Stretch Pants

Not really

1 ltr Bio-Ethanol Spirit

Seam behind the knee.

Scuff too easily

Mens Cyrus GTX Shoe

Easy to use, seems to sharpen the ice screws pretty well.

great material

Trying to clean your beige coloured sandals.Maybe a slightly darker coloured beige wouldn`t look as bad?

Kendal Mint Cake (White) 85g

Mini Filter

Very comfortable fit. Robust. ||| After four years wear, thank goodness the style has not changed, enabling to repeat the style.

Not quite sure how the porch ground sheet works - seems too big for the tent, so make sure you tuck the edges in before it rains, otherwise a pool will form! Also too many toggles on it. Seemed to slightly leak through smaller door zip but will test again soon!

None to date.

I keep mistaking the leg ventilation zip for the pocket zip.

Would have liked the addition of lace hooks higher up the shoe to pull laces tighter around  the ankle

Mens NosiLife Cargo Trousers

Too soon to tell !

Nice to use in hot conditions if you don't want to expose yourself completely to the elements or mosquitos. Obviously great as a sleeping bag liner. Packs really well into the stufsac. Great product.

Kids Terra Waterproof

The orange colour .

Good tough shirt, ideal for jungle and heat, easy to wash and dry,

Womens Terra GTX Boot

Works as good as anything else on the market

Used this type for years ... Keeps brews hot 5+ hours. Excellent.

The  above replies say it all.

They're Rab and decent kit is expensive.  Worth it tho

useful, strong, and rather cute

These are replacements for a pair that turned out not to be waterproof. I do not expect after several wears these will be either.

I have worn two pairs of these shoes every year since I had both my hips resurfaced in metal in 2010 so will have had at least 16 pairs since then. I walked the 500 mile famous Pilgrimage the Camino Santiago de Compostela in 2015 walking for 32 consecutive days in these shoes and wrote a book called TWO FEET ON THE CAMINO which is now published on AMAZON in which I mention these shows regularly. I also mentioned Cotswold in many chapters.

Great fit. Especially for my short legs. ||| Good to have side vents for those hot summer days. ||| Good quality fabrics.

Warm to get into on cold nights |||  warms up quickly ||| Does not slide about on sleep Mat

Still to be tested.

Works really well and smells nice too.

The sole I find to be a bit ‘thin’ as I can feel the bumps and lumps of the trail on each step.

Womens Bamboo Seersucker Crop Pants

Comfortable fit, enough pockets, leg vents.

Excellent cushioning sole

Could include a pocket inside

Quick to apply. Provides good protection.

Men's Medium Brim "The Tilley Wanderer" Hat

No problems

Had to go a bigger size for wide fitting

Below zero they weren't warm enough on their own.

Insoles are a little hard and boots improved by replacing with softer shock absorbing insoles. ||| Initially found difficult to get the ankle area laced tightly enough, now using double twisting on laces to lock off at relevant points.

Decent work trousers.

I haven't yet trialled them fully but I am not sure they will be as waterproof as more traditional styles.

Light, quick drying material which is comfortable to wear and quickly converts to shorts.

it's not that I don't recommend the product, I have not worn them yet!

Nothing.

The price! ||| Some different colours would have been good

Kids Newport H2 Sandal

Comfort, fit and grip. Waterproofing effective and lasted. Used extensively for over three years for walking in the Peak District.

work well

Just the right length

A bit expensive for a pair of socks but I bought them in the sale.

Sturdy and weatherproof.

Looks good. ||| Keeps drinks hot.

Like most shelters, it's a pretty tight fit.  You won't ever squeeze more than two into this and two adults will be cosy.

They grip my head so are secure when lowering head or doing exercise

Lightweight; comfortable; good fit; hood zips away neatly and easily; good length; keeps one dry.

Nice colour and comfy fit

Works wonders with my dry hand and callouses, and in a short space of time has   improved the skin on my hands better than any handcream has managed.

Good size and shape hood. ||| Good sleeve length.

Proofs the walking boots well

Comfortable from the first time I wore them

No negatives yet.

Bit on the thin side; really wanted it to wear with jeans when a T shirt wasn't enough so fine for summer. Don't think  it will be so great in winter.

I have to say that I can't recommend this product. I followed the instructions to the letter and washed 3 pairs of ski gear (jacket and salopettes) in 3 separate loads. Each set was first washed in Tech Wash. There were light marks that did not come out at all. These were the sort of marks that would have come out with ordinary detergent. After the clothes were completely dry there was no noticeable improvement in water resistance when tested under the tap. |||  ||| So in summary rather expensive stuff that doesn't clean or waterproof.

Good fit and comfortable

Comfortable, looks good, pockets for ||| everything

The insole moves against the foot bed producing a constant creak and squeak. The laces are slippy and require frequent re-tying. The fabric has 'relaxed' so much in less than 200k of use that its like walking in flip-flops.

The velcro fastening is a little difficult to use, but it does work well as a seal.

Smidge Insect Repellent 75ml

Comfortable fit.

It's really warm, Packs down small and feel nice to the touch

A little tight to get on around the cuff. Its durability to hard wear will be interesting to see over a period of time.

Small and effective. Perfect for long hikes and wild camping.

maybe not the most stylish.

Serac 300 Sleeping Bag

Very positive grip from the buckle, no slippage.  ||| General look and quality of fabric and buckle.

though secure it flapped a lot in strong winds and was quite tough to put up securely single handed

Quite a narrow fit

Mens Kiwi Pro Stretch Trousers

Looks nice, good fit

Very comfortable and nicely cut. I like that the leg is quite narrow at the calf and ankle. ||| Bought in the sale, so a decent price

The price is a bit steep for the product, it can be found cheaper at other dealers.

Withstood constant rain during a 3 day trek in Iceland

Arms were to long for me but all in all a good tough shirt

Ideal for school or when standing  watching a match on a very cold day.

Really breathable and waterproof - great fit and colour. Packs down into its own tiny bag.

It does what it is supost to.

Trousers are a good cut and fit well. Long leg availability is good with this product. Trousers are pleasantly warm and comfortable to wear. Multiple pockets incl cargo pocket are excellent for carrying all your pocketable stuff. I will purchase another pair of these trousers soon!

Chose a men’s size 8 as it was a little wider and better fit.

Very comfortable and durable. (This is my second pair, having exhausted the first walking the Via Francigrna.)

Not a bad point as such, but I would have paid extra for a sewn in ground sheet.

A bit pricey.

Karakorum GTX Gaiter

Womens Hillwalker Long IA Jacket

Sizing quite small

A lot of money,good,but very pricey

Fantastic stove for walking/backpacking. The beauty of it is stability and ease of packing. It's rapid too, taking about 3 minutes to boil a small two-mug kettle.

Wearing thin on toes after 1 wear

Comfortable and more supportive than the original footbed.

Boot Bag

I ordered this jacket while in Australia before coming to the UK on holiday. I'm so glad I did! It has rained every day, and the jacket has kept me completely dry and snug. I really like the shaped fit, and the longer line at the back. It is true to size. I'm normally a size 10, but ordered a 12 so that I could fit a bulky jumper underneath. The sleeves are a good long length. I'm fairly tall (5ft 8") and the ends of the sleeves sit at my thumb knuckle which is great. The hood is fantastic because it's adjustable, and is the only hood I've ever had that doesn't immediately fall off my head. It keeps the rain off my face perfectly. Very happy.

Most comfortable boots ever owned. Worn in cold and wet conditions so far and kept feet warm and dry without overheating. Appear very well made with a robust sole and good grip.

the price is ridiculous

Oohhhh so comfy! The first time I wore them I climbed a massive hill in Wales off track. I climbed ans scrambles and wades through bogs. They did not let me down one bit.

Nice style

it was in the sale

They worked really well.

Great for garden

Very comfortable and light and come in half sizes which is important

They are very wide legs

It's compact and does the job.

Very easy to use but a bit bland.

"new" fasening buckle can come undone if you lean on something whereas older one never did

Lovely quality, cosy & warm

Not a dislike, but don't skimp on size if you're wearing it over other layers.

Kids Kaleidoscope Knit cap

I have used this range for some time and it has not let me down

Sprung a leak after a year and uppers began to part from sole...... But replaced under guarantee so all good

Casual style but with practical benefits

Tech Wash 1L

Mens Kiwi Zip-Off Trousers

Great shoes, I wear them all day for work, so they are great for going in and out of farms.

My wife lives in it over the winter months, this is her second. Just wore out the first!

Womens Silver Ridge Convertible Pants

Thought they looked ok

You might consider lack of a zipped hip pocket a bad point. I used to like having one until I noticed the zip pull was damaging up my waterproof bike jacket lining - so not a bad point as far as I am concerned!

Bit small and cheaply made

Moon Dust 300g

Womens Pack-It Jacket III

Good quality waterproof walking shoes which can be worn on a daily basis,  as well as for hiking and proper walking holidays. I've walked 20-30 km a day over 7 consecutive days during my holidays in these boots recently and they didn't let me down. Comfortable, rainproof, puddleproof and don't feel heavy on the feet. I also like their casual-ish look.

I suspect the little sponge is going to be worn out before all the gel has been used.

Lovely fit, warm and comfortable

Zilch

Having to go through all 5 modes to return to original full beam.  |||  ||| Magnification only narrows to what a still quite a broad beam. Would be useful if this narrowed further to attain even greater range.

Shame it's a plastic container but don't know what else you could use.

Relaxed fit great for all movement

NA

This is my third pair. I find them comfortable when worn in (have only done about 15 miles in them so far!) and usually find them very durable.

Good looking boots!

Deluxe Pillow

Bag is rated to -4 but i was very cold when it was +1 so this is misleading

They don't like to be tumble dried

Kept hot choc hot ||| Lid doesn't leak

Love the colour and it's soft and comfortable.

No bad points with these trousers and I've still got my other pair which I can't throw away even though I've had them year's.

super light, super comfy, stylish.... endless list of good points.

Can't go wrong with these

Durable and quick to get on.

Quality and comfort at a reasonable price

Warm, comfortable and breathable what else would you want. Already had 2 other pairs.

Expensive for the volume of product which is true of the whole nikwax range.

Womens Alta Bunion GTX Boot

This is my second pair of these boots- my first have lasted well and been so comfortable that I have bought another pair before I needed them, just in case they changed the design.

Bought 2 as a stocking filler for family members as mine so stay dry and protective without overheating on less challenging walks. Just the right length for me. (5' 4"). Service spot on.

plenty of room for bunion - hence the reason why I purchased these particular boots.  Good grip for walking on rough ground. Comfortable. Good quality bye.

V comfortable and lightweight

On long walks I find my ankles get quite sore, despite a thin pair and a thick pair of socks

Warm slippers with flexibility like socks. Great for around the home.

Mens Rupal Jacket

Great material. Great true fit. Highly recommend.

Needs a double zip on the inner tent

It was bought for my mum as she diabetic and the new laws being pushed on sweets it ideal for her to carry around  ||| But I love mint cake

A bit pricey but then anything worth having is :-)

Good comfort, holds your heel well. Currently wearing them in boots 9 hours a day.

Light and very warm.

None. I have flat feet so provide my own arch support insoles - see question blow

Perfect ..easy to put on with boots on 👍👍

Very light, folds small.

Holds shape.  Washes well.

Delta Sunglasses

Easy zip off. Good fit. Washes and dries well. No ironing needed

Good waterproof outer

Mesh lining in sleeves would be nice.

A good wide fit, good sole and they look good.

Compact neat smart jacket

Can't think of anything I disliked.

perfect fit and never need the chin strap

Not sure how to care for this product

Womens Hillwalker Jacket

Lightweight  ||| Stylish, could wear with shorts or a dress. (these are for my wife !) ||| Perfect for those with a narrow foot.

Could be a little longer in the length

'black'!

Would like to have Velcro overlap on zip also I miss being able to tighten base of jacket.

Uses gas quickly

I was hoping this boot would ease my plantar fasciitis - a big ask! - bit unfortunately it doesn't.  Otherwise fabulously comfortable.

very cosy in cold weather.   When washed dried quickly

they are comfortable and fit really well i am a size 13 in regular shoes and could not get climbing shoes that fit well until now

Did go soggy in the creases of the arm in heavy rain.

Mens Microlight Vest

Sole

Thought recycling would be a problem, but you can just puncture a hole through with a screwdriver or a big nail to release any pressure, then recycle in the normal way. So, not a bad point really.

Quite pricey for a fleece.

Simple, easy to fit

Mens Deluge Pro Jacket

It is very light but provides protection in extremely wet conditions. It is a lovely colour too.

When lit it is fast.

Mens Venga Rock Pants

Straps a little fiddly but did not stick out like some sandals.

I'd prefer more colour choices. I'm not keen on two tone trousers for rambling.

Comfy and compact, warm at minus 6.

No!

Good lighter overall does what its supposed to do.  Very good in bad weather

practica

Fine and light & good waterproofing

Nicely aerated

Could do with half sizes as well

A basic design, but it does the job.

They are light but sturdy, and they look great.

Very comfortable, lightweight boots

Womens Glissade IA Jacket

A bit warm on the feet.

Great colour, good long arm and body length, lots of hood room

looks great, easy to use, like the extended ground sheet flap which you can zip up to have privacy if needed. Lots of picnics with my baby planned this summer now!

Wide fitting suits me perfectly.’Comfortable to walk in.

Purchased online from Australia. Fast delivery and will buy from here again.

Not as yet.

Great fit very comfortable

Don’t be afraid to use the chin straps in high winds

This is the 2nd pair of these boots that I've had. I use them daily for dog walking on and around the Ridgeway so during long periods of wet weather they do not get a chance to dry properly however they remain waterproof. The construction of the upper part of the boot to the lower part appears to be better than most similar boots and they can be worn straight from the box , no breaking in period. I use them with ordinary socks

Reactik Headtorch

I use this Offshore as my mattress is terrible. From the 1st day of use I could tell the difference. My back and neck pain were not evident. ||| It easily rolls up and fits in my limited locker.

Womens Journey Mid GTX Boot

Wouldn't have bought them if they hadn't been half price!!

Lovely and snuggly and the hoodie is perfect around your neck.

Warm and comfy; buy when on offer or cosmetic seconds for great value.

Can’t think of any

I liked the colours of my new boots as fed up with too many women's brown boots.

Too cheap and feels it. Has limtied uses as a consequence.

Keeps my hands warm when riding my bike in the early mornings.

Small, compact and easy to fit in a rucksac and offers good cushion for backside when sitting down.

Packs down small and goes easily into the bag.

Got this top in the sale so very good value for money.  Nice feel, very light and colour is really nice.

Even in heavy rain the jacket kept me dry. Hood was well designed to be comfortable & keep my face dry. ||| When zipped fully up to my chin, the collar was comfortable against my face. ||| Lovely to have a practical jacket in an interesting colour with fun bright contrasting panel inside  the collar & around the zip .

It was an expensive jacket in my opinion.

You get everything you need. Amazing value!

For such a spacious tent it's great value and a great quality. Packs away small and porch is great for storage and sitting when rainy!

very firm and stable - I have a  balance/mobility problem and these feel secure.

Ease of use and comfort

These fit great and are really comfortable - except for issue written in bad points

Mens Kyanite Hoody

Lace hooks are not that easy to use, but I hope they will be durable .

Wide fitting- didn`t squash my toes

For the cost would of expected more support in the arch of the foot, although the salesman tried to sell me a pair of insoles , utterly ridiculous price but good try

lovely and soft with just the right amount of stretch, very comfortable. The red trim around the pockets is a nice touch.

Trad Chalk Bag

Amazing quality, keeps me really warm without getting to hot brill

Silva products are well made and builds to last. Easy to use and do all the basics.

Good cushion for side sleepers, warm insulation from the ground.

I found the sizing chart and advice to be accurate.  Well made....at least my last one was....sadly I lost it and was obliged to buy a replacement.

Chalk Ball (60gm)

Compact for usining with Trangias

Heel pull very tight at top but leaves space behind heel at bottom

Seem to be well made. Although quite expensive. They look sturdy, and will hopefully be the only pair I need to buy

Good to drink from

Plenty of pockets to stow everything safely.  ||| Good ventilation for my back.

Great socks at a great price .

Nice and light weight comes with a mini carabiner to keep together

Felt as comfy from the start as my old boots I had had for 12 years!

Can' think of any.

Stiff & supportive but thin, so they don't take up too much space in the shoes.

I love the thickness and comfort.

Chicken Curry

Spacious for two people, with plenty of room for all our supplies in the porch area. |||  ||| Tip: it was obvious once I realised it, but the tapered end of the groundsheet extends outwards with the main door.

Comfortable, durable and fairly light. Very good for summer walking whether in the countryside or on the city.

to thin for trailrunning, requires another layer for insulation

A bit bulky so they don't fit in standard hard glasses case

Bought medium size as I do not have particularly large hands, and found them to be on the tight side/short in the fingers

Great lightweight and good looking jacket. ||| Easily packable and always ready for when you need it.

Sturdy well made simple and comfortable so great for being outdoors

a bit pricey

Nothing, yet.

Mens Interval LS Crew

Laces can work slack.

Lovely colour and fit.

Daytona Polarised Sunglasses

Great jacket for the price and a mid season shell.

Pack down small, light to carry. Very comfortable.

It's a good solid product

Control switches a bit fiddly. Although I have not yet used up the first set of batteries, the indicator lights suggest they will not last anything like the 65 hours advertised.

Does the job

Great all round top for running or cycling. Love the colour. More bright colours Ronhill

I was in between medium and large, settled on medium

comfortable and quite nice looking.  seems waterproof. did the job on in a wet weekend in Wales.

no bad points to report

Not so far!

Good winter fuels mix, does exactly what it says on the tin.

These boots are comfortable & very lightweight, I bought a half size larger than my normal size because I wanted to wear thick socks with the boots.  I think the sizing is accurate.  I haven't yet used the boots in very wet conditions but I'm sure they will be waterproof.

Soles seem to wear out fairly quickly

Comfort & long-lasting

Very light and easy to lace

Great fit, extremely lightweight, with small well thought out details.

Colour on website did not accurately reflect the product. A bit thinner fleece than expected

The clip is quite tricky to attach at the front, so when you've finished your walk you'll get muddy hands when you take them off. However this does help them feel properly "on".

Super comfy, and fit wonderfully.

I think I would have preferred a shiny leather finish for long-term durability, but I understand you can apply a shiny polish to them.

Only pocket is a small one on chest.

Bought for the hubby who loves it.  It's thin but very warm.  Great for rolling up and putting in a backpack without bulk.

Tough Goretex and generally well made

Lightweight. Comfortable.

When you are being pelted by horizontal rain in a 50mph storm on Pen y Fan, there is no better jacket to wear.

I particularly like the length of this jacket as it comes to the top of the leg and covers the bum.I like the elasticated cuffs on this jacket rather than velcro which  seems to attach itself to everything.

Second pair of these shoes. Waterproof and comfortable.

Keeps hands dry and improves grip

Trangia 27-1UL Stove

Looks as it does on screen ||| Nice material ||| Clip has a strong hold

its a Tee shirt

The lid has started to smell bad

An inside pocket would have been a nice addition.

Took a little getting used to feel underfoot.

Very light - perfect for the two of us and the dogs to get into.

Love the looks and feel of these socks

Needs a third pocket( breast or higher up side)  for phone

Women's Traverse Trousers

Moreno Jacket

Comfortable, waterproof and long lasting (this is the 2nd pair I have owned)

Room to put on over boots

Great fit. Dry.

To make them even more easier, shame the under -foot strap couldn't be easier to attach and detach. ||| Anyway I have modified them easily by attaching press studs to them.

Comfy, although haven't been on a really long walk yet.  |||  ||| Nice design and colour.

Velcro straps

Lightweight and pack small, good fit

Warm and cosy while still having some stretch

Beans & Sausage

Didn't keep my hands warm.

Hard to adjust the flysheet to be tight enough to stop it flapping in the wind.

Mens Royale Climbing Shoe

Can't think of any.

Nil

Smaller versions are available

Ranger Compass

Great fit and feel before its first wash.

So handy for the sets of keys I have, at times, to take with me.

good quality approach shoe , well made and comfortable

Very comfortable, too early to assess wearabilty

Unfortunately I haven't found them to be very durable. I found a small tear in the leg after only the second time I'd worn them. Really disappointing  :-(

Light and well proven, if placed correctly to do its job

Quite expensive but time will tell if worth it compared to previous boots.

Lim'Ice Sharpener

Coast Sunglasses

Good quality. Well made.

Nothing yet

Slightly baggy at backs of knees.

Like the feel of the material and the snug fit, I will put them to the test over winter with golf and on a walking break next March

I love the colour.

Size, way it screws into jetboil burner

Beta 450XL Tent

Feels really cost and is a really nice fit

Good design, adequate protection against sun

Womens Respond Mid GTX Boot

Did not come with a belt

Very supportive

Difficult to bend, easy to extract and light.  ||| What's not to like.?

Rannoch Moor Gaiter

Junior Vario Sleeping Bag

Easy to put up and very spacious, love it!

Mens Paclite Pants

Great two person emergency bothy shelter. Light, packs down small and quality build and material.

It works! My Gortex gear gets very dirty and this is so easy to use in the washing machine with excellent results. Tony

Nothing bad about them . They're walking shoes so they don't have the ankle support of boots but really suited me well .

Ample light for night runs

None yet

Very lightweight and good quality. I wore it on  a very hot day and it kept me cool. Washes very well and dries quickly.

They are stylish, well finished and understated. Comfortable from the first time I wore them. Also no cordura or stupid colours. Why do manufacturers have to put pink on all and any kind of women’s clothing. Its ok if you’re 6 years old but after that its plain wrong....

All good. React works very well in self adjust.

Love the colour and it provides a lovely layer of insulation on a windy summers day or on an evening when the sun has set and the temperature is a bit cooler.

Easy fit that gives plenty of space and the warmest trousers I have used.

Very comfortable to wear for trekking and climbing activities.  ||| True to indicated size and feminine fit.  ||| Excellent water and dirt repellent.

Mens Superflux Hoody

The fleecy liner is defo worth getting, as it is desinged for small people and if they are wet, they are prob cold as well.  The zipping system is well-proven, and the overall fit is decent with lots of space to fill out.

The price

Waterproof, it passed the downpour test.

Not had long enough to assess durability

Womens MQM Flex Gore-Tex Shoe

Fold away really small for ease of carrying around.

clips to undo frame a bit fiddlely could do with a plastic key to make it easier

I feel I had a bad valve mechanism - difficult to use and the mat lost fullness overnight - my mate who also bought one had no such problems and was delighted with it - decided to persevere with mine since it got slightly marked that one night - have worked the mechanism a little easier and had it fully inflated and standing up overnight and seems fine now but shouldn't have such difficulties for this sort of price

Fits ok & nice shape

From previously owned pair - keep bungee cord tucked in ( as how they arrive in box ) - as broke on last pair

Instructions for use simple and clear ||| Very easy to apply and quarter turn of nozzle seals unused liquid so it can be used later ||| Fast drying ||| Used to rewaterproof Osprey rucksack and, although use in wet weather has been limited up to now, appears to be completely effective. Has not stained or damaged the rucksack materials

Nope

Soft, warm, moisture wicking

Lightweight but warm. Classic look

Bought because I needed something that I could get on over an orthopaedic boot (I damaged my ankle). Works brilliantly - saves chopping the leg off a pair of trousers, and I can wear them afterwards !

Mens Dart Zip Neck Tee

Very good easy to pump up value for money

Great fit; light weight; easy to wash. ||| Worn it already!

Unique light weight tip that gets a lot of positive comments ! Easy wash and quick dry - perfect.

Very easy to build when you get familiar with the procedure and really good at rain keeps a nice temperature and dry. Very resistant to wind as well when erected correctly.

It's not very stable without the fly.

Womens ThermoBall Full Zip Jacket

Just so very comfortable to wear and very easy to wash

These boots are exactly what I was looking for as I have trouble with bunions on both feet. They boots are wide over the toe joints and yet snug over the heel. Excellent. The padding around the ankle is very comfortable and supportive. I was very pleased with my purchase.

pinches my fingers (if I'm not very careful) whenever I put it up.

Could do with waterproof zipped pockets.

Lots of help in store in picking a good size. Even when I came back to change size, very helpful.

Shame about the price hence I waited until it was in the sale before I bought it.

I found it slightly altered the taste of hot drinks.

Nothing I’ve noticed so far!

Airtech Newmatic Crampon

Did leak once but maybe I'd not secured it tightly

Womens Mistral GTX Boot 2018

Bowl is very big and even the largest of portions looks lost in it. The bowl is also in my opinion overpriced

Light, compact when rolled up, thick, comfortable, self inflating

Amazing product. So easy to use, water boils quicker than on the gas stove and lovely to light a little fire in the morning.

Not sure yet how grippy the sole is yet......

Garment is really soft and snuggly to wear,  ease of wear is great. ||| Bought in the sale so extra pleased! ||| Might we'll look at other colours, although the purple is gorgeous and difficult to beat, in my opinion!

As always, Jack Wolfskin trousers are well made, comfortable and good to wear.

Reactik+ Headtorch

It's a classic, bomb proof design. Relatively compact but still versatile enough to cook proper food. Light enough to walk or cycle with.

Great options to program your own light levels. Really good battery life.

Nice and light, good for my narrow feet. Insole particularly good. Waterproof

Not as warm as I’d hoped

Terra Hogan 2P Tent

Right length - no need to shorten!

Too early to say

Girls Arcadia Jacket

overpriced

Could be slightly wider base.

Solid, well made walking boot. Plenty of support in the sole and nice tough design. Looks like it will take plenty of punishment and come up well but, to be honest, I haven't given it a solid hit-out yet.

A brilliant product. I use it for running in to work with my kit. I've a couple of day sacks of other brands and this one  beats them all, hands down. It's sturdy and a great size. Each component is very accessible and designed for its purpose. The venting in the back is great, with no excessive-sweating or rubbing. Love the colour.

Womens Hurricane XLT 2 Sandal

So light! Looks great, surprisingly durable.

Nothing, though they are not cheap at RRP.

Warm, comfortable and light to wear

Light, snug, and cosy. Perfect for when I climbed Kilimanjaro.

Really easy to use. Effective.

Good fit and seems well made

Don't overstretch the tent cause it might rip the stitches.

It works well

Fast drying, lightweight, comfortable, enough stretch to allow a great range of movement for activities such as climbing.

Clothing Wash & Repel

Lots of pockets, many with zipped fasteners. Great for travelling.

Velcro could be a little stronger.

Convenient

Waterproof and light ||| Wide fitting

It stopped working as soon as I arrived on an expedition on the Loch Shiel circuit now looking for the receipt

No   this is my third pair of similar boots

Very reliable.

A durable water bottle that holds enough water for a day's walking.

Nice fit warm

Really good quality - cosy but not bulky

Does what it is intended to do and is easy to wear

I already have a pair of Meindel walking shoes but wanted a pair of boots so these were a good choice. They are extremely comfortable and suitable for a wider foot which is great for me. I wore them for the first time with a bit of trepidation as I hadn't had time to wear them in. However, I needn't have worried! I wore them daily for a week on the Isle of Mull and never got a blister. Wonderful!

Comfortable, light and great fit.

Kids Crocy Climbing Shoe

Light and comfy

Does what it says on the tin! Good for car camping when space and weight is less of an issue. More cost effective than smaller canisters.

Very lightweight - very waterproof. Perfect for walking in the Carneddau.

General warmth, comfort and plenty of pockets

I'm absolutely freezing with the jacket on - it's like not wearing one at all.

I like the fit and look of the gloves

Stingray XR Polarised Sunglasses

Only worn them a few times up to now, so cannot comment on how long they last, but no issues so far!

Slightly expensive

They are blacker than they look on screen - quite severe

when you open outside door after rain, water pours in and soaks porch area.

well as a man,am happy its not pink!

Zips on 'wrong' side for men.

NeoAir XLite Sleeping Mat Regular

Not found any yet.

I wear the boots twice a day for walking my dog.  They are comfortable and supportive, and are the second pair I've purchased at Cotswold.

great for all day wearing if working outside ideal for walking and quick drying when wet

Tritan Wide Mouth Bottle 1L

It's the price. It's expensive but worth it if you plan to use it regularly

Very light and comfortable

Good Boot ||| Didn't require a huge deal of breaking in. Haven't found anything wrong with it yet although it is early days having only covered 30ish miles in them so far.

Supremely comfortable with secure and adaptable lacing system, completely waterproof (following the application of proofer and wax) and easy to clean.

Mens Mountain Line Tee

Provided a new level of protection.

Very warm and works with mobile phones and sat navs

The belt is not great to hang stuff from ! Ok to keep them up !!But i am using the belt as a strap around a rolled up blanket quite handy that way !!!

66 Classic Hat

Nice look with a quality finish

Great fit and comfort!

Mens Moab 2 Mid GTX Boot

mesh pockets can snag on contents

Compact and easily put up

Shrink a bit but I do use the tumble dryer and probably too hot a setting

Does exactly what it says still a great design after all these years

Mens Exploration Convertible Pants

Mens Moab 2 GTX Shoe

Good quality. Really does keep drinks hot for 4 hours.

Vango Folding Stove

Bought them before, excellent

Spectre 2 Karabiner

This is my fourth or fifth pair of Lowa Renegades. I use them for quite rough mountain walks all year round. My boots have had to endure snow and ice; crossing marshes, scrambling rocks, balancing on ridges and crossing steep, loose scree. Never a blister! Have only ever slipped and fallen when soles have been worn out (and that was on wet moss). Certain types of rock can get slippery in the wet, though. |||  ||| The boots are light, soft, warm, and very comfy, yet give all the ankle support I need when balancing on steep and spiky Norwegian granite. I hope they remain in production indefinitely!

Bought for my grandson as other boots leaked wore them at weekend no leaks hoorah !! ||| Worn for the first time no blisters and he loved them so comfortable he said.

The seal on top is covered.

Evolite Sleeping Mat Regular

Solid boots

Sleeves are a bit longer than required and slightly bulky around the cuffs.

Warm and comfortable. I had no problems with condensation. I did not feel cramped despite being 6'4".

Only the price!

Would prefer more of a cotton mix. A bit much nylon feel.

No found any bad points yet.

Women's Tempest 20 Rucksack

easy fit |||  ||| good length of shorts |||  ||| lightweight and cool fabric |||  ||| reduced price

Very easy to erect, a bonus in bad weather conditions when speed is required.  Lightweight and compact to carry, a consideration when taking various equipment for a camping/walking trip away.  A user friendly product.

Doesn't keep a drink warm for long.

Womens Ineo Pro Pants

Although it’s called a fleece (well it’s made of fleece material) there aren’t any pockets so it’s more like a cardigan.  I still found it useful though.

They don't last; I've used these for quite a while, mainly for foreign trekking expeds, but the soles tend to fall off after about a year.

Could be a bit more supportive around the heel area but tightening the lacing solves that problem.

Fabric rustles too much!

Only needed for cold conditions. (-5 and below)

It's too short. I'm 5'9". It's also a bit cheap. For the price and brand, I expected a bit better quality.

The zip  is a bit fiddly to attach. Something a bit chunkier would assist cold fingers in a high wind.  ||| This is a quality garment but the price could be a lot friendlier.

So far so good. I have not had them long but they are the most comfortable boots I have ever had. Didn't need breaking in as comfortable from the outset. Good for hill walking and rough terrain. Light weight but very sturdy.

No red ones!

The top ties need to be in the "right" side, put them on the "wrong" side and they knock against each other - can be annoying

I value this brand having had same style sandals in the women's version which have lasted for several years. Bought these as a present for my husband and he loved them. He has worn these on holiday as well as at home - great for casual walking, and look smart. Great summer sandals

Comfort and fit

No side pocket as there always was for a phone

Sturdier zip is needed for inside pocket. It's capacious and keeps personal belongings dry, but the teeth of the zip are too fine, and can cause the zip to stick or become detached. A zip is need like the front zip. ||| Side pockets could be a touch deeper to accommodate properly and keep dry an OS map/booklet, for example.

Comfotable and effective

Elasticated  waistband. Vents in legs. Lightness

Nice and light to carry.

Lightweight, comfortable and quick drying. Good pockets.

TX Direct Wash In 1L

Be aware that sizing is on the small side. No adjustment possible of straps around the heel

looks good and like the colour and texture

what can you say about mint cake? its a very strong flavour and packed full of sugar. its literally just a block of sugar but its great for expeditions. pointless buying it with the tin though, i only got it with the tin because it was the perfect size for something else, just buy the cheaper packs.  |||  ||| its great though and does the job

Mens Pack It Jacket III

No options on leg length so I needed to turn up.

Hornet Sunglasses

Very versatile, warm, easy to move around in. Well fitting.

Pegs were of low quality and bent easily.  Length is not great for anyone over 180 CM.

Compact, robust wide mouth

Bit pricey

If you over tighten it it's no good as it cross threads this is my second one.

Stylish, light, comfortable and with useful pockets - but not too many. Look smart.

Very good item to have in your rucksack.

Not sure 100 percent waterproof. Inner sole very hard on ball of foot so will need to change. Blisters after day 3 of walking 16-20 miles, which most people in group suffered.

Good fit, warm but light weight

Tritan Narrow Mouth Bottle 1L

nothing they are great

Epensive

Comfortable, supportive, 40 miles over 3 days without problems.

Easy to put on. Durable. Smart.

Switch Jacket

Having purchased a similar pair of Craghopper winter trousers previously, these are definitely much "baggier". Worth trying them on before buying.

This was the tastiest of the three meals I took with me.

Looks like these shoes really are waterproof. ||| Standard solid lacing system helping a firm fit around the ankle. ||| Fit really good once a different insole was inserted, which also improved the limited cushioning of the original insole. ||| The front edge of the heel of this shoe does have a proper lip thus minimising slippage when walking on muddy surfaces.

Mens Hillwalker IA Jacket

No.  I thoroughly recommend this top.

I would have liked a bit of colour on them and not just plain grey.

Excellent product. Cushions and heals blisters

Nothing bad. The sizing was a little big but not a problem - just needed a smaller size

Hudson 600 Tent

Have worn my (10 yrs) old pair  on a wet and muddy building site for five months recently and they are still almost as good as new. Expected them to suffer hence purchased this new pair but still wearing the old ones for regular walking etc.

A bit pricey

the comfort of the stretch

NONE

A very comfortable and enjoyable product.

Comfortable, easily adjustable, good grip and hand wearing

Good size for in the car cup holder. Keeps things nicely cold or hot

Keep me very dry and the zip is excellent

Extremely comfortable. Amazing stretch in them and they hold their shape. Very warm too. Well worth the money.

Right weight for UK weather except Summer (too heavy). Useful map pocket.

Well made solid construction and quite comfy, bit lower than a normal chair which I needed anyway.

Laces could be a bit longer

Comfortable, can use on reasonable length walk without breaking in.

So so cosy!

Great shoe

none

Very comfortable, hardly needs wearing in! ||| Easy to clean.  ||| Waterproof so far which is a great improvement on my last boots of a different make!

Crushed Chalk 250g Bag

Ellipse Mug

Suited my wide foot perfectly.

It's a pot

Daytona Sunglasses

Really pleased with these - gave me a good sense of security.

Costs seven times more than unleaded fuel. Why????

Brilliant for wild camping as a hot water bottle and the wide neck makes it easy to fill without getting wet.

It took longer to ignite the bio-ethanol than non-bio ones.

Look good

Does exactly what you need it to do. Protects Boots and keeps the car clean post walk.

Womens Chamois Softshell Pants

I liked the large inside pocket which you can get at without undoing your main zip

A good value for money pair of aviator style sunglasses

The waist band has an annoying label stitched into it which needs removing if you are not going to wear anything tucked into it.

Comfortable and easy to put up and down.

Nice top light and well made

Mens Fleet Jacket

Boys Romper Boot

Comfortable, good fit, well made.

Looks great and the kids love them. Very warm and well made.

The 34 long was far too long despite the fact the website said this gave me the 32 leg I normally take. I swapped  to 34 regular which is fine.

Comfortable, very light weight, great in very hot climate, don't crease, very secure phone pocket.

Sturdy trekking sandals, very comfortable.😋

Mens Nosilife Bayame II Long Sleeved T-Shirt

Light weight stylish and weather proof for its design

I'm 5' 4" and a size 8. The 8 is a good fit, sitting snuggly on the waist (below the waist is uncomfortable with a climbing harness and can show too much bum on a bike). The leg length is perfect. ||| No drawcord (drawcord is a real nuisance, decent elastic is much better). No pockets. ||| The waistband is plain black elastic, not the logo version shown in the picture.

Warm,comfy,everything a coat like this should be

Really comfortable fit and gave just the right amount of warmth and breathability. A joy to wear

Footwear Cleaning Gel

Had them before and they are a great fit. Strong laces and eyelets, great feel, light and a pleasure to wear

Womens Nexus Jacket

Nothing

The lace knot tends to ride up off the boot and onto my  leg. I use the provided securing ribbon to prevent this but when wet it is a bit difficult to thread the lace through.

SO far they have been completely waterproof even in long wet grass and they are so comfortable that I didn't have to wear them in.

Amazingly comfy and warm, easy t o wear - once on you don't want to take them off!

Fantastic for friends staying over.  We already had the double bed version and when this came up in the sale we grabbed it!

Makes your feet look large

Lightweight waterproof and wind proof

It works!!

Easy to use strong and reliable

Used it on a multi day walk, really reliable, light weight. Used a airtight container to store in rucksack. Fuel available from most outdoor shops. Pretty indestructible.

They don't last long. For Durability from your Souls, go elsewhere.

Womens Cirrus Flex Jacket

They were terrible.  Didn't proof anything, and a waste of time. The spray version was better than this product

Was a little disappointed that half sizes did not appear to come in the same range of colours as full sizes.

Single Flock Airbed

Bought it to clip on the front of my ruck sack to clip the camera on. Works very well but a bit over the top

Foot straps could wear quickly but could be replaced cheaply

The seams are a bit weak for the type of use I put my boots through, so I usually have to have the toe cap stitched up once or twice during the boots’ lifespan. I wish Lowa would start using stronger and more endurable tread for their seams.

Cosy and good water resistance.  Plenty of pockets

Fantastic but warm beautiful snug

Bought 2 of these to take camping.  Lovely mug an was impressed at how long it kept the tea piping hot.

A good quality and warm top

They have insufficient grip and are lethal on wet surfaces.  For the price these boots should be suitable for walking wet cobbles without danger of falling.  They aren't even as good as a pair of trainers.  Very disappointing and wouldn't buy again.

Lightweight & effective. Unlike previous "goretex" gaiters they breathe well. Can't think why anyone would want to pay more.

The bit that  didn't catch fire.

I could wear then for long walks straightaway worn no discomfort or blistering.  lovely and lightweight.

A full leather shoe, looks good at work or down the pub too.

LTM6 Airflo Hat

Mens Deluge Overtrousers

The lip cracked on first use. Making the item US

Need the next size up  as it is a little tight.

Nothing. I bought another pair of Ayacucho trousers, a different design, didn’t fit me at all.

No pockets

Flavour

This isn't a bad point just something to get used to after having used flip top travel coffee mugs for too long -- the screw top means one has to stop, unscrew, drink rather than while on the move.  But given what this container has to offer, the design makes sense.

Huge difference in sizes 16 are way too big but 14 is snug...

Womens Quest Prime GTX Boot

Very comfortable and although close fitting there is room for a base layer in cold weather. ||| Should be hard wearing.

Very comfortable, good fit and durable

Extremely wind proof and kept my top half dry in persistent driving rain all the way up and down the Old Man of Coniston.

Would like in structions on how to use cord tie

- ?

Wide fitting

No it was all good

With my thermarest in the tent I can't quite sit up straight (I'm 5'9)

Comfort, keep feet dry

Slippery shoe laces but they have always been like that on Salomon boots

Fabric & Leather Proofer 125ML

Robust and unbreakable - ideal for rambling

Effective lighter on awkward conditions

Very expensive

Comfortable to wear. ||| Wear them under my Rab walking trousers and fit perfectly with no rising up or slipping down at the crotch which I have experienced with other brands. ||| Most importantly have always kept my legs as warm as toast in sub zero temperatures.  ||| Highly recommend this quality product.

Good sole for walking on fairly rough ground

You need to you a generous amount per wash.

Full length vents can be unzipped, leaving poppers closed. This keeps you both dry and ventilated even in heavy downpour. No need to keep taking them off and on in showers during mid summer temperatures. Great price point for useful everyday item. Used mainly in Wales so far - perfect match to the spring/summer weather there.

The more you use,the emptier the bottle gets. I am sure this is a design oversight and rectifiable..

Extremely comfortable.The seams don't dig in and the tops are not too tight. They seem to wash well thus far.

These are so comfortable and have very good support.  I've never had walking shoes before and thought I might miss the able support but so far they've been great and perfect for walking in warmer climates.

Packs up really small and light.

Womens Outline GTX Shoe

too small ||| labelled "large", but actually medium

Mens Quest Pull-On

Can't think of any, but haven't worn it out yet

Very comfortable and cosy.

High price

Very warm but light

Soul 300 Tent

Close fitting and very  comfortable to wear.

Hanwag Tatra ll  Gtx

Lovely colour, good fit.

Very light, good quality and waterproof.

Mens Drew Peak Pullover Hoodie

Mens NosiLife Pro Trousers

Very waterproof, not too noisy, good fit

They can be worn at breech length as well as shorts.

Light weight but warm in minus temperatures. ||| Detachable hood. ||| Packs into small bag with ease.

Expedition 4 Compass

Very comfortable, windproof, stylish.

It doesn't make my Crampons any lighter

Not quite as spacious in the toe region as other Meindl boots I have worn. In my opinion this would be a concern for people looking for a boot to suit broad feet - if that's you, try something else.

The Zips could be of better quality, they feel a bit delicate.

TX Direct Spray On 500ml

Very effective

Very comfortable from the first time of wearing, waterproof and good grip. There are no issues rubbing against the ankle as the cut is low enough.

Looks as if it would be easily damaged

Warm comfortable and looks smart. I like the zipped pockets and the hood makes it snug if necessary.

Ideal for what I want.

Keeps the water out

It baubled quickly.

These are my second pair .First pair did over 2100 miles and lasted three and a quarter years of weekly use

I'm not really using it as a cup for myself. I brought it for my dog so we don't have drink from my bottle, when out on long walks

Getting expensive

Simple, strong, does exactly what it was designed to. Folds away to nothing when not in use.

I sometimes do not want bright colours as I use them for work in the winter. It would be great to have plainish black, brown or navy.

Mens Terra GTX Boot

Stretchy so flattering. Leg length good (I'm 5'7" and regular was long enough)

Perfect for preventing crossloading.

Very comfortable, these don't give an annoying clinging feel. Warm enough for serious Winter weather when combined with decent trousers. I have had the top for five years and have found the material durable.

Womens Power Stretch Pants

Great fuel clean and does everything you'd expect.

Nice and light weight

Love the colour

Fabric picks up a lot od fluff!

Does what it says!

Good kit

I get plenty of washes out of a 1 litre bottle.

Stitching around both cuffs came undone within 2 weeks of purchase.

RFiD Waist Wallet Mini

Mens Oasis Hat

It is on the pricey side

Order a size larger than normal if you wear thick socks and hike long distances.

Excellent fit very comfortable

Would have been nice if they came in a clip bag. They don't pack quite as tightly as some other lightweight overtrousers, but the material feels reassuringly strong.

On a few occasions the laces have undone even though I double-tied the knot.  As yet this is my only moan.

They're slightly heavier than my old pair, but the soles are sturdier so should be more comfortable when carrying a pack.

Non

Mens Nucleus Fleece

Stylish and sturdy

Good value for money.  Can cook for hours and hours.  Long lasting and much better than others that we have tried.

Light ||| Stows small ||| Comfortable  ||| Dries fast after washing  ||| In hot conditions is sufficient itself ||| In conditions at the cold end of your 2 poss 3 season bag it'll keeknyou warmer

Nothing negative at all.

Quick drying, light weight material excellent for travel.

Green

Easy to erect

Better fit than Kinectic Plus and more features. Better hood, inside pocket and adjustable hem.

Heel digs in a little

Unable to clip gaiters to the bottom boot lace loop.

Careful with the cord, don't get it caught in velcro!

Stops feet slipping

Good support for foot. Good fit (removing arch support to insert my own).

Camps Bay Zip Off Trousers

Great value for money, small compact and lightweight.

Womens Comfort Light Set

Does exactly what it says on the bottle. My boots look great and perform well.

Pro 500 Torch

Women's Preeti Pullover

Pricey but worth it.

Good quality and styling. Full length zip, so easy to get on and off.  Lovely colour, cosy and  soft to the touch.

Looks great on, love the sleeve cuffs and the wee zip pocket is handy for glasses.

Comfort, fit. Great in when it’s a bit rainy don’t have to get waterproofs out.

Lacing could be easier but nothing else bad

Kept feet warm and comfortable.

very very sweet, but ok...just

😅

Nothing yet, but the velcro may turn out to become the week point in these slippers? ||| The velcro is a very helpful feature though for stepping in and out and keeping the warmth in.

I thought it inflated automatically but instead had to blow it up each night

Womens Selsley Fleece

The elastic waistband has started to fray at the central back seam on the pair that I have had for about a year.  Would be nice to have a pocket.  I am a size 8 for most of my trousers but this size 8 is very close fitting and I prefer the looser size 10 on this, my most recent pair.

None at all

Mens Stratos Jacket

Comfortable, even in the rain and hot weather. Very light to wear and yet very strong.

wider footbed than its predecessor ...wider than I think is necessary which detracts from its overall look

Comfortable feel protected

Mens Crestview Jacket

They fit like gloves very comfortable straight out of the box lovely boots very nice to wear, ||| As usual the staff were extremely helpful

Very soft and comfortable on my feet

Warm, waterproof and has reflective strips

The material feels lovely and soft and is of quality. It is a great fit and looks smart. It's a wonderful colour too.

Lite 700B Sleeping Bag

It takes AA batteries so good for expeditions

Great bit of kit

They could have been more waterproof, they leaked within a week of me wearing them. I’m also not very keen on the heel cup, which is a little too high for me. Other than that, I like them very much.

They look good on a hanger!

Very comfortable, good price.

Womens Spector Short Sleeve Crewe T-Shirt

right hand boot metal stud rubbed against inside ankle bone, I am currently badly bruised and unable to wear walking boots.  Today I wore wellington boots when walking and ankle bone is still very painful one week later.  I will return boots to shop to see if insufficient cushioned area or metal stud in wrong place.

Overall very simple and straightforward and hard to see it could be much better given the very good price. Seems sturdy and will survive the rain OK. Took care erecting so as not to put any strain on the poles.

Lightweight

Tried everything in the shop with and without thick socks. Found the Lowa the most comfortable. Shoes seems excellent quality. Fit is personal so depends on the brand. Solomon and HanWag are also super comfy for me.

Footbed support not as good as my old Teva's

easy to use and actually works not like some similar ones

Chosen as more compact than the Nao; felt the Nao might be too bulky. However still on the large side.  |||  ||| Little worried about the app software. Reading the battery life sometimes requires several goes, and there are a few bugs ....  ||| So haven't dared to try to change profiles yet.  |||  ||| Slightly more fiddly to operate than my Tikka XP,  ||| but I really like the locking facility.  |||  ||| Too powerfull for some tasks; ability to dial it down more "on the head" would be useful.  ||| Hoping to get this through the app sometime.  |||  ||| Overall an awesome light and a massive step up. Love it!

I love these socks. I work outdoors and they are the only ones that don't blister my feet or slip down in my boots or wellies

Easy  to put on

Bought for summer to keep the sun off my face and head. It can be washed and can be folder up to put in pocket.

All over dryness

Nice shaped cap not too oversized like many today. Good quality and design.

Womens Force Short Sleeve T-Shirt

Very comfortable, warm and a good fit

a bit pinched around the arch

Lots of pockets

Light and comfortable, easy adjustable, non-slippery on smooth surface, supports the foot almost like a good hiking shoe.

Perfect for the job and good value.

comfortable straight out of the box!

sizing is a bit out , I am normaly 33/4 but had to get a 36 with a long leg to fit me nicely.

Mens Drew Peak Crew Light Sweatshirt

More expensive than petrol.

Weight ||| Slightly too high in the ankle.

Mens Altus Jacket

Tried them out in the rain today and they kept my hands dry. Particularly pleased as i brought them during a half price offer.

Waist band button is not sawn on properly on all the kiwi pro trousers I have purchased.

Fitting

Easy to put up (but see below), good access to get in and out, overall well thought out and very light

Very expensive!!!!

Nice fit. Comfortable.

Unecessary tape waist tie

Opening right up the outside leg makes them easy to put on. ||| Nice fit.

Gets very hot (melted one container already) could do with a diagram showing what-goes-where.

Temperature ratings are completely wrong. Woke up freezing at 5c and had to put every piece of clothing I had back on in the bag just to get through the night. Warm summer night bag only. One season.

I can't afford more of them !

Lightweight & roomier than cheaper versions, with provision for a supporting pole.

Excellent Product

Safe. Simple. Tough. Practical. Reviews rate it the best water bottle. I can't disagree. I bought two.

comfortable fit

Used every part of the set on my first lead. ||| Very quick delivery.

Ideal for use with my sleeping bag.

They look smart and are comfortable

Lots of loose threads. Expect better

Truly waterproof. ||| In cold weather can add fleece underneath. ||| Great colour choice. ||| Light and easy to pack away.

These glasses are excellent value for money. They perform well, are comfortable and are very affordable for someone like me who breaks and looses glasses but still wants a decent pair.

Had to keep pulling them up as they kept slowly moving downwards due to low waistband

Quite expensive for what it is

Feet get hot in very warm weather. However, it is worth compromising on hot feet because of the comfort of the boot.

Zip pull could be larger

Good arch support

Style

Mens Force Short Sleeve Tee

The foam applicator sponge is poor and applying the cream is much easier using a small piece of cloth that can be discarded after use.

Nothing to dislike

Perhaps no range of lengths

Really warm & comfortable

Only one colour available which is not a great one.

A bit short for walking boots

Really comfortable from the start. This is my second pair.

Light, stretchable, shower proof. Use on hill walks and for cycling in v changeable weather.

Great design, fit and fabric.

No zipped front pockets to stop money falling out. ||| Difficult not open rear pocket with 2 buttons. Should have had a zip

Cypress Table

Womens Whisper Sandal

it's gas in a tin what more can I say

PAK Poncho

Mens Fast Hike Pants

very comfortable and so far very waterproof

Mens Kiwi Winter Lined Trousers

Really poor purchase. Soaks right through after 20 minutes of light rain

A bit on the pricey side.

Needs good sweater beneath to stay warm in cold/windy weather.

Womens Momentum Crop Tights

Light weight

Excellent fit, extremely light and durable.

Womens Renegade GTX Mid Boot

Womens Altus Vest

I like the coat a lot but would prefer a few more small pockets.

Light weight, sturdy, well balanced, user well proportioned and user friendly.

They make them for skinny people and not good fit for anyone with a muscular & broad frame

good fit

Blister Kit

Really comfortable to wear - good value for money

A great product.

would have preferred  more colours.

The really deep cargo pocket, enough room for OS map. ||| Unusually, a zip on the front slant pockets.

Purchased because the fit was good.

N/A

Need to put something on the ground to keep it stable and stop it burning the grass etc.

No pockets.

Nothing stands out

None it's ace

Handy for rucksack for clipping gloves and hat on in winter

Remember to fish out the little bag before you add hot water!  ||| Having to wait 8 minutes before I can eat it!!!

Nice shape, light weight but good protection ||| Can be a nice sleek fit

Extremely comfortable

Very cheap for something that could save your life

Very light and comfortable from the start without the need to wear in.......

Warm, well made

Don't fold down as small as i would like and are pricey

I have yet to see it bead off

Zephyros 1 EP Tent

Light, immediately comfortable, good lacing adjustment. Ankle cuffs very comfortable and soles offer just the right amount of support.

Lovely bright colour.

The glasses offer clearer definition of shadows which is helpful when driving down leafy Sussex roads. I find them really useful when helming a narrow boat for the same reason.  |||  ||| I also like the wide arms that help block incidental light behind the lenses.

Although it fits well overall arm holes a bit snug.

Light weight, compact and a high quality product, ideal for my forthcoming expedition across Central Africa.  Although expensive but then good equipment never comes cheap.

Warm and comfortable. ||| Lots of pockets, several with zips. ||| So much better than the women's version ||| which has no belt and half the number of pockets.

So comfortable, light weight, breathable.

comfort like an ordinary shoe.have worn them continuously for past 3 weeks all round Orkney. wet, sun, tarmac, moorland. |||  lovely.

Melted whilst cooking supper in camper van.

Great style, people recognise it as quality

Good selection of gear to get started

Easy to fit. The Harness was bought at a sale price for Spring/Summer use. No further comment available.

Tiny light weight relatively cheap

Zips!! Very fiddly and constantly catch the material every time you do them up. Frustrating

Initially a tight fit but stretch after a few uses. Well made and comfortable for all day climbing.

Comfortable for hikes/rambles

They are comfortable, long-lasting and  good on rough ground with their thick soles. Along with my walking shoes and walking boots I have the complete set!

I cannot yet be sure that the product penetrates the leather well.

Leaves streaks on boots and doesn't keep things the same colour

Ruggedly stylish, leather construction & not the usual fabric type. Well designed, good fit typical of Italian shoemakers (albeit these were made in a Romanian factory).

Comfortable due to thickness

Comfy

Look and feel brilliant

Mens Altay Shirt

Excellent jacket

Comfortable to wear easy clean

Comfy to wear and drys well on the fells.

Knot not tied in peg bag cord to stop clip coming off and I didn't notice in time. Doh!

Lightweight looks good

Cosy and warm whilst nice fitted style. Lovely big hood.

Comfort.

Premium price point

hard to put on because they don't slide. This also inhibits the stretchiness.

Nice fit, comfortable

This coat is not bulky but it is very warm. The rose gold zip and NF motif is a nice touch

Thin soles, can feel every stone I tread on. Considering how hot & dry this summer has been they leaked the first time they got wet & the first early chilly walk I did my feet were cold. Boots returned, waiting for outcome. Don't waste your money on these.

Style and weight. I was looking for something lighter and brighter but this was the only product which fitted comfortably.

Fiddly to put on and hate the inverted lace hook. I've given up on that lol still think I'd prefer a zip to Velcro fastening but maybe il warm to it.

Great fit, and really kept top of boots and trousers dry in extremely wet conditions.

Expensive.

Silnet Silicone Seam Sealer

Expensive, so I was glad of the sale price.

Comfortable boots that fit perfectly first time. These boots are easy to walk in and can be used anywhere.

Womens Puma 2.0 Harness

Very light and well made waterproof trousers. Good practical long zips.

Front pockets quite shallow, so be careful with your possessions

Compact and lightweight, bright with a long range.  Can’t really tell about battery life as not had it long enough, so gave it an average score for that.

No problems so far!

Pricey, so I wouldn't have them for every meal but great as a celebration on last night of a trip.

Power Stretch Contact Grip Glove

Stylish, flattering

Way too expensive for what they are but what price can you put on comfortable walking boots.

Womens Brianna Hoody

nil

None.

Smal fitting

Reasonable price and cool looking.

Straps rub a bit,

Sale price good, ordinary price?

Torque Nut Set 1-4

Down Wash 300ml

Nice long sleeve length, washes well and soft of the skin

They are on the expensive side though if they last for years then perhaps the overall initial purchase cost isn't too high.

You've sent this survey to me too soon, so I can;t rate the item based on actual use, which would be more useful to folks

Very minty

Light and easy to carry. Comfortable to sit in.

Well made. ||| Good pockets.

Hard to pull on at first

Comfortable from day  1

Expensive

Does rely on the item being tumble-dryable

Kids Pack-It Overtrousers

It’s a wee bit dear but then I don’t use it that often

loads of space...reasonably easy to erect..40 mins from start to finish..not bad for first time..will be better next time..good height..i can just stand upright...put a 6ft camping bed in inner tent..loads of space..like all the pockets for nick-nacks..have been a camper for over 35yrs and have had a variety of tents..this one rates up with the best of them...very wet and windy weekend...tent gave no cause for concern at all..the internal support straps seem to work very well...no rocking af the tent at all...and this was in north wales

No this is a good product.

Stylish and practical

Womens Oban Sky Jacket

it leaks

Olive Bungee 76cm (Pack of 2)

Not as yet !

Easy to use and very successful as a product

Mens Paclite 2.0 Jacket

Have not yet had opportunity to really test the shoes in harsh or very wet conditions

well made

Strong, sturdy and not too heavy

Can use fuel quickly if in wind, simple to rectify with some form of shelter to protect from the wind.

Slippy on wet smooth surfaces

Price a bit high

Great colour, nicely moulded to my feet

Easy to put up single handed and packs away easily. The only thing I find is the small uprights can be a slight nuisance in blustery conditions

First time for ages I have felt comfortable walking.  Pain has eased.

Concerned about getting them wet

Good Goretex jacket for the money

It keeps you warm. It keeps you dry. It keeps you ventilated. Great fit. Great value. Great look. Its incredibly comfortable. If you've got an option to spend £130 on a coat, this is the one.

The fit of the trousers is very good and the leg length is more than adequate.

They are waterproof.

Mens Oakridge Waterproof Shoe

very easy to boil

No hiding it is a high sugar product. |||  ||| Ideal before an ascent!

Little tight round ankle

Light and very comfortable with plenty of pockets

Keeps me and my backpack dry!

Small and compact  ||| Easy to use

The price too expensive...

Not keen on the green colour

easy to use and gets the job done

Light weight ||| No need to 'break in' so put into immediate use ||| Good foot support

cheaper than electrical heated socks

Nice closure doesn't leak chalk, opening is nice, wide and "stiff" so it's easy to dip in a sketchy spot

Dries quickly

Mens Vojo Hike 2 Mid Texapore

Overhead canopy could be slightly bigger

Very comfortable . Good foot and ankle support.  Tough, robust construction.

Good sole. No breaking in required. Very light and easy on the feet.

Quite expensive

Price a bit steep, but quality so suppose get what you pay for.

Must follow the instructions carefully to work

comfortable and dry from the start

Because they are so smart I'm reluctant to get them muddy and scuffed on walks!

Wear them straight away, no breaking them in. They feel stable. Leather is much better than man-made fabrics, vortex or not.

So cosy, snug fit & comfy!

nice colour. soft touch fabric. ||| cosy to wear. light to carry. ||| modern styling

Compact easy but really effective. Used it in preference to our larger camping stove.

How light it is yet still warm

It was on offer and seemex good quality.

Excellent durability, good quality.

Helvellyn 200 Tent

The green colour was OK but for a festival a tasteful pink with swirly patterns would have been better. A bit much to ask for when buying from the men's department maybe :-)

Chicken Tikka & Rice

Very comfortable. Easy to inflate. I like the push/pull valve

Expensive... but worth it if you need well-performing thermals

Makes me smile everytime

Very comfortable and stable platform ||| More like a boot in the style of

lightweight, inflates quickly with a little support from yourself at the end to give more firmness. ||| also deflates very quickly. |||  ||| very comfortable and cant wait to use on Kilimanjaro sept 2017.

The built in belt.

Would not have paid full price but happy with two with one at half price. Too early yet to critise actual product as have not used it for long enough.

They have slightly more bulk than the regular Craghoppers trousers - it is a slight trade off between that and the extra warmth

Dark material, quick to erect and reasonably spacious.

Sizing was very much on ungenerous side  ||| I am a 6 and really struggled

great hat worth the money.

I'm kept dry in all but heavy and prolonged rain.

They have the colour coded zip fastener which makes putting the legs back on again really easy. They dry quickly.

Drinking cup is very small.

Functional yet lightweight, stuffs in a daysack without knowing it’s there until needed

comfortable

Product penetrates the leather to give god waterproof protection for several outings, depending on conditions.

My 12 year old is now too big for the £50 junior coats and this is a big step up in price.

Extremely comfortable and well supporting shoe.

It did the job it was supposed to.

Salmon and Broccoli Pasta

excellent fit & support

Unlike a previous one of these we bought, there was no pocket to hold a pillow. Rab seems to have changed the design.

Comfort straight from the box, lightweight, well made and with out a doubt a quality boot.  First pair of Lowa boots I've had but would buy again and recommend.

Strong but comfortable

Cosy and good value for money

quite expensive.

Easy to pack and carry.  Tasty when eaten hot.

Womens Sirkos GTX Shoe

a bit more colour might help, perhaps some colour in the laces!?

Compact.

They appear to be waterproof

Only rate it as a true summer/indoor bag. Anything below 10 degrees and this wouldn't cut the mustard.

It is all good. If anything  a zipped pocket would be good on each leg instead of on one leg only

Did the job of repairing a 15mm rip in our tent very effectively (applied to both sides

So far they seem to aid my walking

Excellent for fast boiling whilst lightweight camping

Had a little bit of rubbing on my little toes on a couple of longer hikes but I may just need to adjust the straps slightly. Squeak a lot when wet but then so do most sandals of this type. Perhaps a little expensive at full price.

..

The overall look and fit is excellent. High quality materials.

None really but all feet and left and right are different so a one size fits all will never quite work

Quick and easy to assemble, boils in no time.

Excellent ankle support. Very sturdy reliable boot.

Does exactly what it says on bottle. Can't live without it.

Not only very comfortable and supportive but they look good too!

It keeps my feet dry and is comfortable to wear. This is my second pair

comfortable,looksgood, really keeps you dry ive had 3pairs over the years

Myo Headtorch

G10 New Classic Crampon

Light weight and comfortable

Not really.

Bit on the short side.

Make my feet look larger than usual in walking boots. Squeak a little at present, but they are new!

Cheap, compared with others on the market

Comfy with great ankle support .

It does what it says it will- what more can one ask for?

Integrated end poles make pitching quick and easy.

Good size, great for side of pack.

Such a practical item for any toddler living in the lakes :)

Great fit - strong stitching and elegant quality appearance

Good hat, good price

Grate product, ideal as a light mid layer.

Just a shower proofing on full grain boots!

After sizing these correctly using the guides and questions, I was extremely disappointed to find these way too small! I am usually a 14-16 and I ordered a 16...according to the fit I should probably have ordered a 20! I was unable to try the trousers on the trek I had purchased them for and was forced to order from elsewhere but not to the spec I required. I have kept the trousers as I intend to loose weight and will eventually get to wear them!

Perfect if, like me, you don't like drinking from a bottle and also are happy to refill  with tap water to cut down on plastic bottles

very poor clip system at the back of the hat which sticks into your head and make wearing the cap uncomfortable..so much so I have binned the item.

Made bottom of my leg a bit tender at firest but just st pooed lacing it up so tight on top  lace hooks.

Shrank a size after its first wash having followed the care instructions to the letter. A real shame as it’s a nice shirt.

Very warm and comfortable- I bought a second pair. Could quite easily wear them all day! Fab for dog walking in cold, wet weather.

Doesn't come with even a webbing belt. Would be a more comfortable fit if it had an expanding waist facility (lots of trouser manufacturers and retailers do this now). Moving up a size makes them too big

Container 60ml

Very comfortable straight out of the box with no rubbing or chafing, and this is without wearing any additional padded socks.

A great plastic  mug. It held my tea and coffee, and the handle meant my hand didn't get too hot when drinking a hot beverage. If you are looking for a plastic mug, this is the one!

Well made and good quality.

Mens Kahuna III Sandal

Immediate comfort

Mens Kinetic Alpine Jacket

Needed a fair bit of heat to get it to soak into the leather.

Quick and easy to put on and adjust ||| Crampon bag provided

Bit pricy normally  great sale price  but quality as good as adult version

Not really a bad point, this is quite a large single mat.

It's great and I wear it all the time. Nice feel / fit, looks great

Soft feel, light weight and good fit.

Tastes great.

Great looking sunglasses  ||| Just perfect for cycling in Devon

Feathers are coming out of seams. Is this normal.

Womens Rupal Jacket

Has the merino benefits of anti-odour and comfort, but tougher wearing than other brands.

Works well, used in Otterburn in the summer and kept me midge free. Easy to see through and packs down small enough to not really notice.

Came with the zip skewed by a couple of teeth at the bottom end which meant it was jammed and took a huge faff to undo it fully for airing. Doing it up again was also tricky.

Kids Iceland 3in1 Jacket ll

I returned the first pair after the silly little clip broke on the knee cord.  The latter is very fiddly and difficult to manipulate in cold weather with gloves on.  Velcro fastening is not as good as a heavy duty zip.

lovely looking hat

The measurements up the side are great, so that I can also use it as a measuring cup, which is originally what I needed.

Comfortable, true to size

Comfortable straight out of the box

Long zips make them easy to put on. Pack down smaller than most of the more expensive pants.

Pockets a little shallow. Would have liked "toggles" attached to the zips to allow easy operation. Grasping the zips can be tricky especially with gloves.

The colour and fabric

The strap that goes under the foot is too slippery so it slides off its buckle. |||  ||| Expensive

Well presented, Comfortable, Excellent Quality

comfortable and well made

Discovery Mat

I thought they would be warmer in cold weather

Longer length than similar jackets; ample hood which fits easily over a woolly hat and doesn't restrict movement; gloves fit easily under sleeves; feel very snug and well protected from icy winds when fully zipped up; (can't comment on waterproofing as didn't have a single drop of rain on West Highland Way last week!)

Well tailored. Great fit. Very comfortable.

Not always the most price competitive - seem expensive versus other options but I still buy as trust the brand - and when your life depends on it!

Womens Nebula Pro Jacket

comfortable without losing precision, velcro works very well

Deadman Snow Anchor

Lovely colour.  Very comfortable and light exactly what I wanted in a waterproof shoe.  I will be using them more when I am on holiday in a few weeks but so far am totally thrilled with them.

Price made but you get what you pay for.

bit overpriced for a bit of foam.

Mens Övik Fleece Sweater

Marks easily, which is a plus or a minus - definitely encourages you to be aware of where your head is when squeezing up something..

Good pocket design, and water bottle holders on the sides. Comfy to carry. Good colour

Vents on the sides of the legs are particularly useful |||  ||| Zip and popers on the Calder area are good

Not as good as a Tilley hat polyester makes my head hot

For me a hook for securing in my kayak would be great 👍

Great tent, we've used it every time we've been on the beach this summer!

Magnesium Fire Starter

expensive

None so far

They do the job. Easy to get on and off. Easy to get on when wearing boots. They pack up pretty small too.

Price ||| Looks ||| Comfortable

Plastic buckle broke but i needed a proper belt anyway.

It looks great. Better and stronger than a traditional gazebo. Packs up small

Comfortable ansd warm - lots of loops round the waist for the belt.

Very neat and smart

Pretty much everything is good. This was my fourth pair. Being waterproof has been essential this past winter.

Mens Cragside Jacket

Boots are super light weight and extremely comfortable and definitely waterproof

Fiddly and hard to light in adverse conditions.  (Which are normal for when and where I want to use it.)  Still trying to figure the best options for this.

Silk Liner (Standard)

Good fit, soft learger

Zip chest pocket

My wife loves these socks, they are very comfortable and keep her feet lovely and warm.

Storm 375 Lumen Headlamp

Very light to wear. Good for the wider foot.

Down Proof 300ml

Main zip is a bit tight. But love it overall

Doesn't leak

Like the colour and feel of these socks. Really comfortable and warm not too thick

Light weight and easy to wash and dry quickly.

A minor point but I was sealing a jacket which involved applying the silicone and letting it set, then repositioning jacket the next day to apply to next seams. An extra application brush or 2 would be handy. Like i said its a minor thing. The product works well.

Great to find a small enough size.

makes garment look like new

Very comfortable. Good ankle support.

Snug fit so didn't slip in the boot, a nice length up the leg (long enough to tuck trouser legs in if necessary, but not too long to be annoying and wash well.

Pretty expensive

It is hard to go wrong with icebreaker. I know that it fits me, I wear it everyday, it doesn’t smell and it looks good.  Expensive - yes ; but value for money? Definitely!

Great quality and fit. Very comfortable and washes up well.

The price , much too expensive even though they are great !!!

Elasticated cuffs give a snug fit.

Glasses broke straight away. |||  ||| I was told they would be lightweight and good for Kilimanjaro however they felt heavy on my face and caused head aches, Very disappointed!

They fit comfortably

Can be a bit messy if you off spray something because you need to remove any exesses with a damp cloth

But pricy

Fraggle II Full Body Harness XS

It’s waterproof

It's very difficult to measure the amount of liquid going into the sponge end.  Either too little comes out then, giving it an extra push too much appears and is wasted.  A spray would be much more beneficial.

A lot of washing/drying time

Used recently trekking in the Himalayas. Kept me warm and protected the sleeping bag which I had borrowed from a friend.

Usual Meindl comfort

Reactor Thermolite Liner

Generally comfy with good support

Small, light. Powerful.

Protect my eyes

Just miss the fact that my original coat has a storm flap on the hood so that it comes over your chin good in very cold weather.

Really good slim fit with the extra long leg

My third pair. Comfy shoes which can be worn year round.

Very comfortable and warm

Sturdy.  Do the job expected. Good fit.  Easy to put on.  Wash well.

Malawi 2 Pop Up Tent

I purchased these half price and would not have paid full for them. ||| I find bits of debris like pine needles and seeds easily get stuck in the ribbed upper section of the sock and then snag threads when trying to remove, ruining the sock.  This has happened on previous Bridgedale socks too sadly. ||| They are thick for cushioning which I understand but this does make your feet get sweaty more quickly as they are so thick.  Taken to taking them off during lunch breaks when hiking so they can air out a bit.

A bit pricey, but a good product, 1ltr bottle is the most cost effective way to buy it.

The USP for this light for me is that the strap is detachable. This means you can attach it to a belt round your waist or chest and you can see the relief of the ground better than when it's on your head, (because you  get shadows). Also the switches are then easier to access. Much better, too, if it's raining or misty. Using 4 batteries at a time rather than 3 is a great plus when using rechargeables, (you can't recharge 3 at a time).

Arms a bit too long on me . ||| Zips can catch in fabrics.

Needs ironing after wash

Jetpower Fuel 230g

Womens Kahuna III Sandal

Very supportive. I have bought the same boot before and that gave me years of great service.

Black Footbed

Nothing so far

Excellent

Womens Merino 200 1/2 Zip

price

Even though I chose sandals with a vibram sole, like my walking boots, I find they don't grip on even slightly slippery surfaces but, hey, they're sandals, I'm not putting myself in life threatening situations while wearing them!

Well-fitting and stretchy - they've worked well both for climbing and for walking.

It keeps my drink nice and hot

Light weight and good grip. Very comfortable. Used for walking as well as general footwear.

gave low score because they are described as waterproof and they are not. they might be showerproof at the most.

A solid compass with clear markings and romer scale. Also the rubber bits on the base help stabilise the compass on the map. Needle seems very responsive.

not suitable for winter

Difficult to make flow out of the bottle. I had to squeeze really hard.

Womens 175 Everyday Cami Top

Really comfortable and washed very well

Ease of use |||  ||| Rugged looking design |||  ||| Choice of colours

Straps need to be able to pull tighter. I am on max with no space left to tighten further x

Style, fit and colour

Mens Quest 4D 3 GTX Boot

Style and comfortable to wear keeps strong sun off my head whilst gardening and walking

Wish there was a belt included.

They pack down well.  ||| The full-length side opening makes them much easier to get on and off. ||| I kept perfectly dry in the first heavy rainfall!

All the chalk stayed in the bucket

Mens Cornice III Jacket

Comfy fit

Great looking trainers for various activities.

Comfiest boot I have ever worn.

I think I prefer a sock that has a higher wool percentage

Very comfortable look great

Best hat for trekking I have ever owned.Keeps your head cool in warm weather and is ideal for shading your eyes in sunlight.

Womens Tibai GTX Mid Boot

They look good.

Keeps warm for 3 hrs

Mens Q2 Classic Hike Boot

basically awsome

Bit baggy in places and pockets not very deep, change keeps falling out.

Love how easy the tent is to set up. Top quality too and very light for hiking.

Functional but smart too.

Comfortable shoe, can wear for any occasion too, looks like a normal shoe.  Great fit and actually popped them on without socks as emergency, still as comfortable. Would recommend and buy these again.

My son lives in it !

Like the pale blue detail on zip and logo, shows up well against navy background.

Pockets not deep enough or enough of them.

The soles. Good grip. Feel like a shoe.

Picked this up for a bargain price in the Sale - fantastic value

Icon Headtorch

Nice and light boot  ||| Seems rugged

Keeps drink got for about 5 hours which is good for mobile working

Very comfy. Waterproof. Nice looking shoe. Quite light on feet.

Mens Peakfreak XCRSN II XCEL Low Outdry Boot

Nothing. I am not a 'kid' but love my hat. Lots of people have admired it.

Very light and compact

The look and buying a shoe that 100% covered what I was looking for.

Mens Spector Long Sleeve Crewe Top

Very comfortable straight out if the box. So far no really bad points

It’s smart casual and no worry about cleaning bills

Needs to be ironed

Would like it to be longer in the body.

Excellent for arthritic knees!

Nothing so far other than they are quite expensive.

Lightweight and comfortable

Small enough to carry around, but large enough for a good brew

Does the job. I wore them in for a walk in the Mournes Mountails last week while wearing shorts and they kept grit and heather out of my socks and boots.

Fixed poles in the ends of the tent prevent it from being folded smaller to pack in a pannier for cycle touring....

It makes a very irritating whine when it's turned on.  I also have the 200 lumen head torch which is impressive.  I expected the 500 to be awsome,  but it doesn't seem any brighter than the 200.

As someone who has narrow feet and can never find shoes or boots to fit these seemed almost miraculous when I first put them on.  Not only did my feet not swim in them but the heel held my feet.  A total joy to wear I walked in complete comfort from the moment I put the boots on.  THANK YOU

The material very easily pulls/bobbles. Very easily rubbed by other fabrics/velco of Rab over jacket :(

Maybe a lttle thin for outdoor hill walking and so I would pack my overtrousers just incase

Don't know as haven't full tested them yet

Light, warm and very comfortable to wear. They also fit and look good.

Laces ,why don’t all the boot makers put flat laces on instead of rubbish round ones that constantly come undone !

Quite heavy

I was missing a couple of guide ropes and they didn’t supply enough pegs to pitch tent and anchor guide ropes. Nothing major but would have expected enough.

great allround  boot

Can't wash it

A smart and practical jacket.

Really comfortable. Folds away easily into stuff sac

It’s very thin, but good for layering.

Reasonable calories for the weight - edible.

Quite expensive but you get what you pay for I guess

Very good, hard wearing, comfortable straight away.

Don't get much in a roll

Nice smell. Easy to apply. Secure and robust container.

Superb jacket. Comfy, warm and looks good too.

Snug fit

The fabric is rough on my skin. I can feel the seams. The waist is tight but the legs are a bit baggy.  ( I have a small waist and hips)

Fit, comfort, practicality

Fantastic material warm and light

They’re not bad but I’m an old Heli Hansen fan.

They get very warm very quickly.

Well made, warm, comfortable robust and pretty hard wearing .  Very versatile. Use them as leggings for Pilates,  country walking on colder days, under another pair of trousers for extra wind protection, good for round the yard and horse riding. Wear them all the time any time!!

Earth 4 Tent

The laces work a bit loose even when double knotted

Smart appearance. ||| Lace up to provide good comfortable fit. ||| Good grip on wet stone.

Does a good sealing job

Fitted very well - no blisters on first outing. Good ankle support. Not too stiff.

Very comfortable and fits very well. Seems quite durable.

Good friction and grease removal

Really comfortable well designed and look stylish

Comfortable fit for narrower foot.  Cushioned insole.

Most comfortable sandals I have ever owned. Excellent grip, good fit, true to size. Got these in rock bottom sale, only, less than half price - bargain.

Nothing to not like.

Event Shelter 15x15ft

Having bunions makes finding comfortable walking boots difficult, these were comfortable from the start, I have worn them daily for regular dog walks, and they continue to be comfortable and waterproof.

Good body length and attractive colour combination.

Not available in black.

I wear these all the time in winter as a normal day sock.  Shoes/boots need to be next 1/2 size up to allow for thickness but I never have cold feet. Gave a 10 for value for money as only buy when on offer.

Look good, very comfortable

Plastic press studs are  very weak when removing from the boots ||| Plastic clip is not easy to locate onto the walking boot laces and is on the wrong way round

The cost didn't equate the quality of the sock.

Revitalised my favourite walking boots.

Use two capfuls - the cap has an inner cap and so I am never sure whether to fill the larger or the inner circle. I find the inner circle does the job.

It is quite expensive, but worth it in my opinion.

Not really a bad point but the button to turn on/off can be hard to press if you have trouble with your fingers or big fingers, like me but having said that, it's not going to be wasting battery in your pocket by accidentally been switched on, so again that just an observation about the on/off switch

Great piece of kit and a good price. Great for all activities

Used as fuel for a homemade burner using a coke can, cut in half.  ||| Once it's alight, it's as effective as non-bio ethanol. Doesn't smell so pungent.

looks good and can be worn for casual as well as in the mountains/ climbing wall. ||| Nice long sleeves which allow articulation without pulling and long zip for ventilation.

It's a gas cartridge

Very happy with this product, no bad points on my opinion

Womens Lifa Crew Top

Not yet, still waiting to give it a proper road test.

It fits well is comfortable

no

I love these pants so comfortable and light weight and wash well

- Removeable insole allows me to use my own footbed. ||| - lock hooks on lace up allow greater comfort at the front of the boot while keeping tighter lacing around ankle.

Womens Maestro Climbing Shoe

Plenty of room around my bunion. ||| Very soft leather ||| Quite light

It's great, and non messy. I use it mostly for yoga practice these days- it really helps prevent slipping on the mat. ||| It will be just as good for climbing as it 'stays on' much better than the powder. Doesn't seem to dry hands as much as the powder.

1 litre Fuel Gel

I like how they are a wider fit and comfortable from the moment I put them on. I liked the colour the laces and the blue colour isn’t too bright. It makes them quite feminine.

Not as robust as my previous salomon walking shoes. Laces don't look strong

Warm and washes well

The fit and comfort

Expensive, but I suppose quality comes at a price

Macaroni Cheese

Raven Ice Axe With Grip

Warm and with move ability

Decent width across toes fit over bunion

Works well reproofing Gore-Tex jacket as new.

Brighter colours for walking boots please - Brown's so drab!

Womens Tallahassee Jersey Dress

Mens Hiker II Stretch Short Sleeve Shirt

Comfortable walking sandals

I like the style, I liked the price, it does a great job of keeping the sun off my head and out of my eyes.

Quite expensive.  But that depends on how often you are likely to use it.  Cheaper options are available but won't last as long

Boots are very light weight, and soles are beautifully flexible. I also like the colour scheme!

Slider Belt

Beta 350XL Tent

Can't open a pack of jelly babies while wearing gloves.

None, as only started wearing them.

Warm and dry

Womens Pacer Trousers

Trangia 25-2UL Stove

"It does what it says on the tin"

Made long distance walking so much more comfortable

Very soft and comfortable upper.

So comfortable. I wear them almost ever day out dog walking.

Could do them in a funkier colour, laces  could be better quality

Always good quality

Easy to refill and ignite- top lighter in windy conditions

Would have liked a colour choice (I like grey) but it's the comfort and function which really matter.

Very easy to use and seems effective in removing the dirt.

Sale price made it ok value, expensive if full price but very good regardless!

Probably the best gaiter I have tried.  Easy on, great seal and the stiffness is just right.  The gaiter is almost self-supporting without the calf cinch but still has a nice flexible feel.

Very comfy. Look good.

Personally, do not require the two positions, just need trousers not shorts.

Light, packs small, survives in washing machine on delicate wash, inexpensive

Absolutely nothing, I love them!

Incredibly small and light compared with my old 500 cl flask.  ||| Easy to clean as the neck is wide and straight.

Hosteller Liner PC

Men's 100 Glacier Full Zip Fleece

Very light and comfortable to wear

Has helped my posture a lot. Very comfortable to wear.

It very comfortable, ultra lightweight and amazingly warm considering how light it is.

Would have liked thumb holes instead of tight cuffs

Looks good , I liked the side panels in different fabric- shade of grey is classy

Light and very comfortable

Good fit- bought next size up after reading previous reviews. ||| Caught in a shower and water beaded on them instead of soaking in. ||| Recommended.

Very poor foot beds for the price. Put my own in.

Disk on base detached after first use. ||| Rubber seal comes off regularly.

These boots are the perfect weight and can do anything except 'proper' trekking.  For everyday walking on hills or elsewhere they are absolutely ace.

Difficult to get into pockets in under trousers. |||  ||| A slimmer fit at the bottom of the leg would be better

Cooking - easy,  Taste - yum,yum

Easy to apply

Moji Light

Great shoes, in fact my old ones lasted over 3,000 miles of walking and I searched out a new pair exactly the same make/style as the old ones!

Have both American and UK sizes on store label-very confusing.Had to exchange the first pair!

Will leak after extended use when the lip of the bottle gets worn ( there is no seal in the lid ) .

Bit expensive.

Hispar Gaiter

Have to be carefull about measurement of water. One scout put too much in.

comfort is the mainstay of this sandal

Lovely dry and warm on freezing cold days 😀

Girls Moab FST Low Waterproof Shoe

Sometimes doesn't remove really grubby stains out of my off road motorcycle gear. A bit of scrubbing helps though.

Worked really well for Duke of Edinburgh, fitted really well into a rucksack and didn't add much weight.

Easy to fit.

needs improved arch support

Good for the kids when scouting

Rhino HMS Screwgate Karabiner

Very warm

Grivel Crampon Bag

Light weight, easy care, very comfortable and well finished. Really pleased with my purchase.

My first time using this product & i found it easy & straight forward to use in a washing machine . I was pleased with the end results and will continue to use this product to clean my insulated down clothing for the foreseable future.

Lightweight, easy to put on over walking trousers.

I haven't suffered wet feet yet.

A good fit, Velcro fastening at the front woks better than I thought.  Although the hook at the front is a bit of a pain to put on it works very well once it is on. I like the weight of the material they are made from and the heavy weight patch to protect them from crampon spikes. ||| This item is obviously designed by someone who knew what was needed.

Every bit as good as the orthotics I had custom made and they cist a fortune.

Fairly expensive.

Style, comfort and length.

Good breathing and stance. Width of fit.

Superb quality & fit

Extremely warm yet lightweight and easy to squish up and carry around if it turns out warmer than you thought!

The insoles in these boots are not good.  My feet hurt after wearing several hour so I switched the insoles with my cork insoles that were in my Cabelas Perfekt Hikers.  It was a night and day difference in the improvement in comfort.  A little tighter in the toe box with the cork insoles but they should stretch a bit.  The Meindl cork foot beds are far superior then the stock foam foot ends they came with.

versatile, as can be used as long or short trousers

Very fiddly to attach / secure hook around laces. Poppers at top are a bit cheap and fall off easily. Don't really need the popper tho as Velcro is tough and stays shut.

Compresses down flat and is stable when extended.  Base can be used as a chopping board.

more pockets would be better

Waterproof, comfortable and sturdy

Great for travelling abroad to Australia in January!

Lacks very simple yet essential features. |||  ||| No chest pocket??? Where should we keep our wallets then?  What a rip off.  |||  ||| Zip on the inside is reversed which means unlike other 3-in-1 jackets by other brands who follow standard convention, with TNF you can only use TNF fleeces. Sneaky move TNF! Try it and you’ll see.

Comfortable fit, plenty of zipped pockets, fabric lightweight but ok in snow etc, dry out quickly.

Leather Conditioner

It's expensive.

Very comfortable! ||| Packs small and is light. ||| Does not need much puff to inflate.

Paste Wax

Buttons fiddly to operate when wearing head torch

Not the smallest of lightest option, though it's better for cooking than the lightweight options.  ||| The more expensive gas version is easier to cook with.

Very adjustable ergonomics (great for scouts), quality materials and lots of thought gone into the design. Fabulous price in the special offer too.

Best dried food I’ve tasted yet!

Loved the price and the quaity

Lightweight, good colour, fit. I don’t feel that it is baggy.

Good value, easy to put up

The food was tasteless stodgy and only acceptable after a long day's walk ||| A variety I bought in Sweden was far superior although considerabley more expensive

I can slightly feel the shoe where my ankle bone is though I get used to it when walking

Expensive but got at a discount

I have had problems with my ankle bones with other makes. After a few long walks/climbs these are so much better.

None found

lovely quality and great fit, looks very smart

Very comfortable with good durability.

I hadn't realised it was only shower proof. No good for electrical sound equipment if there is threat of heavy showers. Please can you make something similar that is!  TY

Mens All Season Glove

Excellent value for money. easy bag to use.

none so far

Zip doesn't work smoothly

Good quality footware

bit expensive

clear

I have found no bad points.

Good close fit. Great mid layer for milder weather.

Mens Tokee Full Zip Fleece

A tight fit if you're much over 6ft!

its a good fit on me.

8 Hour Mosquito Coils (Pack of 10)

Easy to put on and kept lower legs dry

Very comfortable, seems warm [not washed it yet]

Thinking of taking it going to inspect the stiching, the pegs are pretty rubbish

Slightly more narrow at the toes than my previous Merrell shoes.

This really helps with those pesky midgies in Scotland and also really helped with the mosquitoes in the south of France that are REALLY bad this year.

These trousers are very comfortable both for simply walking and for climbing or mountain activities where stretch and flex is needed. I haven't used them really hard yet, but the fabric appears to be a good balance between breathability and durability.

Very easy to assemble. |||  ||| Solid construction.

Womens Arco Jacket

Great fitting trousers that don't hang off you but still allow load's of movement. Good pocket arrangement with zip's aswell.

Easy to use on all types of clothing and accessories

Not so far

ProBalm 28g

Nice and thin yet strong.

Would have liked a higher rand round the toe.

Pricey, but better with YHA discount

Fit isn't the best, but for the price they can't be faulted.

Didn't need to buy them. Old ones still going strong!

Comfortable, plenty of adjustment

Light weight, comfortable, full leg length zips.

These are the best flasks we have had they are brilliant at keeping hot and the same for cold

Style and performance

The sponge tends to give out before the liquid runs out

didn't work at all

I really enjoy the size of the bag. It isnt too large to be bulky and in the way, but it is latge enough to fit both hands in for chalk. |||  ||| I also like the double loop locking mechanisms that it has for the chalk. It is very convenient and really holds it in.  |||  ||| This is my first chall bag and i was a little hesitant at first but am more than happy with this item.

This is my third pair, excellent for day wear and for comfortable walking the larger hills here in North Wales.

Easy to for child to put on and wears very well.  Excellent shoe.

Mens Vibe Boxer Modern Fit

An extra gear loop would be great

Light and cheery. When set up properly, will survive a thunderstorm completely dry. Easy to pack away. Perfect for carrying around hiking/camping.

Helags Hat

I bought it for my son and he is delighted with it.

Sole grip is excellent and they are a very comfortable boot.

Amazing fit

Kendal Mint Cake (Brown) 40g

Really warm and cozy

A good range of protection, everything you need for a basic rack. Can't tell you about the size 10 offset though as I dropped that in the ocean on the first outing.

Because gbporch

These are my second pair of this great general hiking shoe.  I really recommend them.They are comfortable from the first time you wear them and have never given me a blister. My old pair are still waterproof (they are at least two years old), have no rips or faults other than the sole has got thin due to the amount of walking I've done.( I do a lot of long distance trails.)

Good value for money

Sirius 200 Sleeping Bag

A little bit more expensive than we expected but it's definitely worth it!

Good fit and warm

Lacing can take a while to get it comfortable, but that might just be me...

Looks good

Great summer tent ideal for weekends Easy to assemble

If you don't want to spend too much this is a good basic backpacking tent

Ugly looking

The memory foam footbed is a nice addition, lace up is simple and effective,ankle support is rigid enough to offer good support, yet supple enough to not cause discomfort.they are much lighter than my north face boots so they are a great upgrade. ||| The vibram sole is the real deal and will offer you good firm grip even on slippy clay slopes, (tried,tested,approved.)all in all a fairly pricey but well built comfy waterproof boot(however I Nik waxed mine out of box they don't come well treated)combine them with a pair of seal skin three layer thick waterproof socks like I did and you have days of dry hiking underfoot!

Sleeves were too long ||| Very expensive  bought for me! ||| Bit thick to go under a coat

They could have a bouncier sole. Most waterproof walking shoes seem to have quite rigid soles, but it would be nice to find perhaps either a slightly less rigid sole or perhaps a spongier insole??

It fits my boots... what more do I want?

Technowool Slipper

The small is too small to work with gloves ||| Would have preferred to buy a pair of mediums or larges instead

Light sturdy boot and comfortable for first wear on a short but boggy walk.  ||| I have narrow feet and these are a good fit for me.

not overly trendy looking

The colour and fit are good

good size..nice colour..

Comfortable and light.

Although a good product, I think a bit pricey

It is a perfect outdoor cooker for me as an angler! Easy to use light and very compact.

Don't know yet how waterproof they will  be. Poor instructions on care and proofing. I would prefer the higher level of Gore Tex protection to be sure that they are waterproof. The comfort Gore Tex has to be less waterproof. A bigger toe cap protector would help as the leather still gets lashed by grass on the top of the toe.

Great Colour and body length

Dynasty Compact II Stove

4-6 Person Shelter

Certainly keeps you warm and is comfortable.  ||| Recently went wild camping and despite the temperature getting down to 5 degrees it kept me warm and has a good level of comfort.  ||| Time will tell on the endurance

Excellent quality and performance.   Also liked the colour.

Shadow Screwgate Carabiner - 2 pack

comfortable .

When walking through bogs, feet are slightly damp

The beam of light is absolutely brilliant for the size of the torch!  ||| The ability to switch between light beams and also the SOS light signal is a brilliant feature, Very well done. |||  ||| 3 AAA batteries, excellent idea! |||  ||| Grip - Excellent. |||  ||| Love this torch!!

Good leather

Very comfortable.

Womens Firewall Jacket

Robust and simple to put together and use.

It wasn't as warm as I had hoped.  I used it on a trip to the Highlands on a damp but warm week in August and was only just warm enough - I can't imagine it being adequate at 2 C. |||  ||| It is also very narrow.  I am small of build and wondered how anyone broader than I would manage.

Colour perfect and comfortable for walking on uneven terrain

Womens Approach Pant

Does what it says on the tin!

Good adhesion

Men Reaxion Amp Crew T-Shirt

smashing jacket

Easy to use and useful dimming function. It's nice, bright and light!

Rubber rand around sole protecting leather and high sewn in tongue

Colour and fit

Shape and handle

Now on the 2nd pair of the best boots I’ve ever had !

Narrow fitting.

Oozes quality; robust enough to cope with everything I throw at them and comfortable enough to wear loads.

Soles a bit slippery on certain wet surfaces

looks really good

Keeps you warm, like the bag it comes with to pack it away.  ||| Overall a very good jacket

Theres no rain channel above doors to keep rain out of porch area

Mens Nebula Pro Jacket

A little expensive

Great scarf, my daughter loves it.

They have stretched a bit much after purchase, I should have bought the next smallest size had I known they would streeeeeetch.

Would prefer the lace in the neck not to be pink, but not the end of the world.

very comfortable just put them on and go walking

Its cheap and fairly simple to erect if the poles do not snap. |||  ||| Its light and compact. |||  ||| It has a low wind profile..

End of one lace has already frayed.

Its very lightweight and well ventilated, so good in very hot tropical weather, and big its roomy enough to wear a bag or small rucksack inside

Vapor Helmet

Most comfortable trousers ever bought

Entrance at both sides very smart idea makes so much sense 

No mess in pocket, great for diabetics who need a quick fix.

It's a bag, it works like a bag.

Good quality and Vibram sole.

very solid for the amount of waking I do @72+

Comfort and look

In a previous pair of Meindl boots the tongue tended to slip round to the left and that's after lacing boots up using the hook on the tongue which I thought was supposed to stop the tongue moving - it didn't !!!

Not yet but only been out twice..... Rain ☔😬

Wash really well, breathable and comfortable

I think they are quite expensive at full price.   |||  ||| It is also disappointing that Rab seem to be going with different types of fleeces now as the new style does not suit everyone. |||  ||| One point to consider - it's best to put overalls on before you weld, unless you want an earphone hole in the pocket!

Good padded sole. Warm

Would have bought more than one if there had been a better range of colours

Thought it was packable. Its travelled quite well as I stuffed the inside and made sure the brim was on a flat surface.

It is lightweight and looks great.

easy to use

Adding a Sunwall or 2 makes the event shelter a lot more practical, particularly if it is a little bit windy and you want some shelter

Kids Hot Shot II Fleece

Pretty smelly, but in an addictive way

Cleans waterproof or special item well, waterproofs stay breathable and in good condition.

It’s lightweight and waterproof. Ideal for long walks.

A robust but very comfortable boot.  Lots of width at the toes but a good fit elsewhere.  Mine were fitted with a pair of volume reducers that created a snug fitting.

Really comfortable with a very good sole.

Sturdy, good grip, comfortable

simple and easy to store

Lightweight and compact

Side pocket that an OS Map will completely fit into.

A little heavier than expected when empty, adjustment of back panel depends on velcro - not sure how long that will last.

Good quality, well made and very comfortable to wear.

Well designed attractive style flask

Comfortable, sturdy with nice crisp lenses

Loving the big front zip and front pocket.

A really comfortable boot, great for camping and light hiking

Thermal Mug

Relief they gave and prevention at early stage

I like to open the bag once there isn't much left inside, and it's just a bit too granular, bit I'm nitpicking.

over-priced at full price

easy to use for my purpose

Nice and long - but I'm short so may not be long enough if you are tall!

Good every day mug.  ||| Still warm after 8 hrs if not opened.  ||| Very hard warning

Kids Baseball Hat

My daughter loved it. Super warm and looks smart too.

Typically hasn't rained since I bought them so can't give a tried and tested review, but do like the fact they have a high waist so you don't get back gap when you bend over.

A few loose threads

Light, comfortable and feel robust. High top above ankles.

Trailblazer Footbed

These were a great bargain on sale. They're superb socks and I expect them to last for ages - Bridgedale socks usually do. Well-cushioned but not too thick. Really comfortable.

The price recently went up unfortunately.

Really soft material and much nicer texture than a regular fleece - I wear it all the time!

Fantastic colour. Great fit

The Velcro up the front makes the fit semi-adjustable plus the Velcro on the under foot strap makes the adjustment easy.

Lightweight, waterproof and comfy - and a bargain in the sale!

Pumping it up - whilst it isn't really that difficult I am thinking of investing in an electric pump.

Zip is exposed and doesn't work so well when it gets muddy. Just a minor issue as it's such a great jacket!

Mens Torrentshell Jacket

Amazingly lightweight, bright, and superb shape for keeping in pockets. Would heartily reccommend. Love the variable light ability.

They changed the text font prefer the only font

Perfect for narrow feet

Women's Momentum LS Tee

Twisted Skewer Pegs 10 x 18cm

As long as this keeps midges off me then I will be happy.

Looks good - keeps drink hot- practical size

Comfy fit made from good quality hard wearing material. High back.

A really comfortable fit and not to baggy. Whilst out hiking one day the rain poured down on two occasions and product did not allow the water to penetrate.

Easy to put on and adjust. Easy to wash and dry.

Very light and small

Womens Wicken Fen Trousers

i really like the firmness of the sole.

Loop for coat hook too small

As they are "wrap round", they keep the sun out when coming from the side, unlike normal sunglasse

Fits well, looks good

Light and easy to pack

Light and really quick to set up

Great practical tent - we use it as our campsite tent (as opposed to our Quasar for wild camping)  |||  ||| Great size, plenty of room for 2 or 3 people. Easy to put up - fly first.

Like many other people I find they ride down at the back

The only glove I have tried that remains waterproof under pressure from rock holds or even walking poles.

Very durable. Can survive just about most anything! Easy to drink from and fill up.

Lovely bit of kit

Could be cheaper

Good weight size and shape for winter walking and leash good too

Little bit overpriced

significant weight reduction over earlier models without loss of functionality

This is my first pair of climbing shoes and I'd rate them as a good entry-level shoe. My climbing has definitely progressed.

All Purpose Soap 100ml

Nil.

Very disappointing. I had my previous Berghaus paclite jacket for ten years and this one is a poor replacement. The first thing you notice is that there's absolutely nowhere to stow the hood when not in use - not even a simple Velcro tab for rolling it up. This means that in drizzle it's likely to collect water before you pull it over your head. The zip is  very poor quality nylon. It cannot be unzipped from the bottom, making it unsuitable for cycling, climbing stiles or sitting in a car. It's already pulled apart twice while I was wearing it. It has just two pockets which are low down and obstructed by a rucksack waist strap. There is no other pocket for valuables or a map. The fitting is small for the size. There is no internal loop for hanging it up. It may be suitable for a casual jacket in showers but is not suitable for serious hill-walking. I bought it for under £100 when it was under offer. I certainly would not want to pay the full price.

they are bags

Womens Ontario Lady GTX Shoes

Tastes a bit bland

So comfortable from day one.  Haven't done a really long walk yet in them but up to about 20k they've been great.

Very light weight & compact unit. ||| Good price considering the cost of pack of chlorine tablets. Especially as this unit will basically last a lifetime if looked after

It is an excellent walking shoe and is wider than the average.  Very comfy on both rough and level ground.

it's Ok

Lid has changed design from my last one, doesn't fit rightly like the old one

Good fit very comfortable to wear.

Not a thing I could wear them all day long

Expensive but good

They are comfortable to wear. The waterproofing works well, keeping my trousers clean and dry.

Waterproof, inexpensive, my second pair.

Looks good, keeps my shorts up.

The zips seemed relatively un-sturdy so I worry they may be a problem in the future.  |||  ||| Getting in and out is a little tricky because the outer door can only be attached open at about half its height. It also folds inwards so if it is wet you will likely come in to contact with it on the way out.  |||  ||| The groundsheet is not a bath tub so in very long wet grass you might get a bit of moisture on the inner.  |||  ||| It is hard to get the fly absolutely taut without a lot of adjusting. Having said this it does not seem to be necessary to have it taut for good protection from the rain.  |||  ||| Despite these points I would still highly recommend this tent- you can't have everything!

In my opinion: ||| Hood is very big and drawstring don't really tighten enough. ||| While the jacket is rain protective, when zipped up I found that I really sweated badly after about 20mins brisk walking particularly within the sleeves.  Would hidden vents help?  For me personally I would prefer a detachable hood but it seems the trend with a lot of jackets is to have a full hood.  It's still a quality jacket but maybe a little overpriced at full cost without discount or on sale.

Has Merrell's look and feel of quality.

Very pricey compared to other brands

The hurricane glasses are are good and strong which I really as I'm prone to breaking glasses very often

Excellent for outdoors in the icy weather.   Kept very warm in these!

Most comfortable hiking boots I have ever bought and I was able to fell run in them.  Awesome as always Salomon.

Used it recently 3 days hiking in glencoe, first day it held up well in lots off rain, it took on a certain rigidity when wet which allowed it to be shaped over my varyfocals and to continue wearing it with my hood up. Next day was warm and sunny and it did an excellent job in protecting my head from the intense sun. Third day did ben nevis there was intermittent rain, I just tilted it forward no need for my hood up which helped in keeping me a bit cooler.  ||| Hand washed it the night I returned and it was easily dry enough to wear early next morning.  ||| Loved the olive green colour, the retaining cords and overall fit and comfortable feel of the tilly wanderer. ||| I spend a lot of time in the mourne mountains and it will be with on every future occasion.

No, but pricey

Nice looking boot, good firm sole. Easy to tighten up lower laces by just pulling where they crossover. The anchor points keep the lower laces in place so you can have looser/tighter across the lower foot and a different tightness higher towards the ankle. Haven't yet worn them in rain.

The compass is made of hard plastic which clearly has two scales on its sides. Clear indication of North.

They wash well time after time.

Sleeves were too long

I found the waterproof material of the tent very effective. The geometry of the tent makes it nice and warm in a cold day.

Purchased to wear as a liner for motorcycling in cold weather. It's warmer than expected.

The boots were unstable in streams and creeks,and tree roots

Ideal base layer, good quality and look

Top end of what I would want to pay for a light weight top

Clip belt rolls over and cuts in to skin sometimes - design of belt could have been better

No breast pocket.

NO ZIPS!

slightly lumpy when tied tightly

Dont know if it works yet.. hasn't rained on the tent since we used it!

Pants in this shape are necessary for some medical conditions

Long zip

Square Sunglasses

Pasta Bolognese

These boots are very comfortable straightway. Worn them every day for dog walking. Very supportive and soft around the bunion area. I like the lacing lower down, feet feel secure over uneven ground as well as going up and down hills. Very well made.

Stretch

- warm ||| - new two way zip ||| - comfy Velcro cuffs

None yet, but just started wearing them.

The inability to use it where there is a significant risk of rock fall from a variety of angles - which may lead to injury through the large ventilation spaces. This limitation is made clear in the instructions and also in the reviews.

Much bigger than the description indicated, needed to get the smaller size.

Nicely padded and easy to put on!

So comfortable, my Son wears these for work

Power Gas Cartridge 230g

Zip Cooking System

Mini Karabiners (Pack of 3)

Tiny pack size.  ||| Warm and comfortable

Comes in short fitting size and like the velcro adjustment at the ankles. Good value for money.

Very soft and comfortable without being too warm

love the trousers

Renegade name not really necessary

Womens Cornice 1/4 Zip Fleece

These leggings are used for hillwalking in the UK, and also get lots of use on my bike ride to work! The fit is brilliant and the ability to get these on and off when wearing my walking boots, with little or no trouble is very important. The fact that I am on my second pair says it all. Just brilliant!

slight lack of stability when placing pan on, although this is expected as it is small and therefore supposed to be this way

Mens Mistral GTX Boot 2018

Comfortable and easy to fit

Definitely dsnt go down to-1 like it suggests. I was freezing in the peak district

Completely comfortable for walking - mainly the dog in long wet grass. Dry very quickly.

Fuel Bottle 1L

Very warm in cold weather.

Non slip coating. Looks good and feels good. Also keeps liquid hot for as long as I need it to.

Like the double strap system & the vent in the top.

Wired good and dropped waited on the back. Very warm. Packs down well

Instructions could be better to set up the torch bluetooth connection and actually explain what the buttons do!

Not so keen on the lime highlights.

Mens Camps Bay Trouser

Excellent fit. Very comfortable, good for distance walking. Second pair. ||| Would recommend every time.

Does what you want it to

The hat is adjustable so a very good fit can be achieved |||  ||| The fabric is comfortable in hot conditions |||  ||| The hat has an excellent upf 50 ratings so keeps the sun at bay |||  ||| The hat's rim provides good protection without erring on the side of being too big

Easy to break in and very comfortable walking over uneven surfaces or rocky trails.  They also keep your feet warm.

Very comfortable. No blisters when wearing them in.

A little narrow and slidey

The grip could be better.

Not firm enough for my 80 years old gut!

Rugged construction.

The laces are tooooo long.

Womens Native Mitt

No but would like pockets.

All Purpose Soap (200ml)

Keeps the sun off balding heads

Door opening leaving the door on the floor of the inner. Also the two  carbon poles very confusing on where they inserted until I researched it on you tube. Outer door could do with a holder on the outside.

Very warm! The

High price for what it is

Fit my boots and feet perfectly but not everyone's feet are the same. Best to try them in store in your own boots.

Comfortable. Positive feel on rock

awkward (slightly) to get on and off

Mens Velocity V Climbing Shoe

Disappointing and would not buy it again

Very comfortable

Cool pad for forehead

Slightly too short, maybe.

Bright colour but no garish. Good quality. Excellent value for money in the sale.

Stretchy, showerproof, windproof, comfortable. Great all rounder

Waterproof & comfortable

None really, they're marvellous. However, I would have preferred them without the red trim so that I could wear them for less obviously 'sporty' occasions as well as for walking & mountaineering. |||  ||| PLEASE also make these perfect trousers in plain navy so they can pass as Scout trousers!

I sprayed the top of my boots where they used to let in water. Now they don't.

It is very light, folds up well and is completely water proof.

Mens Abisko Trail Fleece

Sales assistant was brillant you didnt have shoes in stock they were delivered to my door by Saturday amazing service

Length of the body could be slightly longer

Although I perspire the hat doesn't stain like other hats

keep feet and ankles very warm

Colour choice

Alpine Bod Harness

Turboflame 2 Lighter

Comfortable, Lightweight and good all round boots

Jetpower Fuel 100g

Very stable for larger pots, pans or kettle yet compact, I don't use case but wrap in piece of cloth and store inside my small kettle, valve very controllable, and overall has a good degree of build quality, oh and I'm fussy. Ps the small size gas cylinder fits neatly into a 12cm zebra Billy can so together what more do you need?

Slim fit so they don't get so dirty round the ankles when it's muddy.  ||| Shrugs of a shower of rain.

No, this is good stuff.

I love my boots but I don't love the fact that my gaiters don't fit.

Hood can block vision

East to put on and take off

Canvas Brass Belt

Industry standard I suppose - been using one of these since  I can remember - standard issue (albeit in mils) in the military - and really? What's the point of using anything else? Brilliant, and classic bit of kit

Warm, comfortable, stretchy

Pleased

Huge range of colours

Reasonably easy to put over your rucksack and can be put on in a strong wind

Stylish good looking shoe that is very comfortable and surprisingly lightweight.

It is a bit dearer than ordinary washing powder, but it works.

I love that they are longer in length. Most women's waterproofs are too short but I've finally found a pair that got properly! Woop!

No bad points for this boot

Very comfortable. Accommodates my wide feet well. Love the colour.

Looks cool ||| Stays on

Newport H2 Youth Sandal

Good support and comforting to my feet

Tent & Gear Solarproof 500ml

clear to see, good sized base plate and smooth dial rotation.

Stable in wind, even without the guys. ||| Everything else as I would expect from a 2 person tent.

You can clean it in the dishwasher

Has 1:25000, 1:40000, and 1:50000 measurements. A clean design. Simple and very effective. Not cluttered. Easy to use in all types of weather. Not too big, not too small.

Extremely comfortable to wear and a really good length.

It does what it is supposed to do.

Vixen Harness Starter Pack

Waterproof but not the warmest will add and insole for that orbit overall very happy with them

Has got a zip neck - did not realise this from the photo's

Event Shelter Sunwall 12x12ft

It is a large chalkbag! Combined with the ridged mouth it is a little troublesome to pack if you're short on room. Consider the "sport" chalkbag if you want to save space. Also with the  wide opening and lack of drawstring, I have lost a chalk ball out of this.

Hi Vis Guy Ropes (Pack of 4)

nothing

So far, really comfy, very light. I wore them for trip to USA national parks, did quite a bit of walking in a variety of weather. They look great, can't totally judge quality, will see how they fare over the next few months.

Leather uppers and overall comfort

A good wife fit, comfortable from the offf

Half sizes would be good, although the Velcro is adjustable

A comfortable fit, good water repellency and well made.

Fine enough to stop midges

the shape makes them easy to fit in you rucksack

Nice light jacket

?

waterproof10

Kids Puddle IV

Comfortable from the start, managed a 7-8 mile walk without any problems. The sole appears to grip well. Would highly recommend them.

Not really a dislike but they are slightly heavier than boots I am used to. However, that also makes them robust and I am sure I will get used to it without any problem.

G-Wax 80g

Womens Paradiso Jacket

Not very warm.

The elastic round the waist doesn't hold the trousers up

I was glad the shop assistance suggested wearing these superfeet in my trekking shoes for the pronating arched feet. Would not have bought them otherwise. They have supported my arched feet from the moment I wore them. Just had to get use to them for a few days, after that they were fine. I thought they were pricey at first but in the long run with the amount of trekking I do they are absolutely worth it.

Pricey and never discounted

Womens Sabina Top

The warmth and feel of the material

Functional and good value for money.

Very comfortable and lightweight

not sure if its my waist size but the top band on the waist feels tight, I have had 36 waist before and they feel fine

Functional, look OK. Perhaps not flash enough for some. Perfect for me.

None really

Comfortable

Should have gone for longer handle, it was available!

Womens Tibai GTX Low Shoe

Nothing so far!

Don't like the colour of the hood string

Compared to other softshell jackets I have this one seems to take longer to dry but thats the only thing bad that I could find with this jacket

Am pleased with this shirt. Always difficult to assess the quality of the fabric and the way that it has to be cared for from the online description.

Light,well ventilated and well constructed.

A little noisy if you move around a lot in your sleep.

Womens Cyrus GTX Shoe

TH5 Hemp Hat

Great size and fits well into the jetboil itself.

Bought for my husband, who hasn't worn it in extremely wet weather, but is happy so far.

Great value and ideal for low level camping.

I bought them to wear in Sicily and found them cool and comfortable for walking.

Good sole for walking long distances.

Blue Footbed

Feels very comfortable, light-weight, the hood fits nicely and does not slip down

These shoes are comfortable on rough tracks and have good grip.  They seem to be waterproof so far.  Their fairly flexible sole is suited to moderate to low roughness surfaces.

Expensive, but if you want quality...

It was great fun playing with the nozzle,what joy

doesn't smell horrible and easy to apply

Quite low-waisted - need a belt!

Really good, exactly what I was looking for

Good fit, very warm in colder weather, toasty!

Like the raw power and controllability. I can run in the light of it without risk.  |||  ||| Like the option to adjust power, but haven't had to yet. Expect to need this for longer bike rides, so hope it works OK!

Solution Harness

Shoe laces thin and weak

Laces Come undone as they don’t catch on the metal fittings properly

cheap, small, easy to use, good quality

The lining grips a shirt sleeve making it difficult to put on

Did wear down inside the back heel within a year.

Wonderfully warm but not sweaty.

Lightweight, didn't get too sweaty and look pretty good too.

a wee bit pricey but worth it had to go to a size 11 usually a ten and half fit perfectly. i ordered a 10.5 just felt they were just a tad tight but had them changed no bother what-so ever

Price was higher than I had initially intended to pay but comparing with other comparable garments, the above good points swung it for me.

Extremely light, very quick to inflate and deflate. Excellent but if kit.

It kept me warm. I expected it to be very slippy but this was not how I found it so that was a relief.

fell to bits arround waste band

The sleeping bag is light and pleasant to touch.

Mens Short Sleeve Mountain Exploration T-Shirt

Longer length than a lot of other jackets.

Comfortable from the start

Slightly on the heavy side, but as my feet are too long for ladies shoes I do need to compromise. ||| Swapped the insole for one with additional cushioning; original very solid.

Mens Quest 2.0 Boxers

Sadly, not waterproof as it said on the label!

Womens Vizion Rhythm Tights

It works.

Light and tasty

No cup holder

High quality and nice feel

Pricey.  ||| Bag provided awkward to put crampons into

No blisters

During rainy weather water will come in by entering and leaving the tent.  ||| Only the sides have entrances. The front cannot be opened to make a porch.

Lovely soft but warm material.

They are advertised as waterproof but 4 hours in to a 10 hour ultrarun in moderate rain my hands were wet and getting cold.

Very good fit

It created good suds

Bought this as the starter pack with belay device, karabiner and chalk bag, went for the DMM Viper as this harness is used for hire at Harrogate climbing wall so must be good at taking a lot of use. Strap buckles do grip well as I have used other harnesses where the strap slips back through losing tension.
